  FastAPI with hexagonal architecture patterns in Python.
  Use when: building Python APIs — only when Python-only libraries are required (LangGraph, PyTorch, transformers, etc.).
  Covers: API design (Pydantic + auto OpenAPI), domain modeling, ports & adapters, service layer, error handling, async patterns, testing, Alembic migrations, pagination, healthcheck endpoints.
  Do not use for: database schema design (use database-design skill). Default to axum-hexagonal unless Python-only libraries are needed.

# FastAPI + Hexagonal Architecture

**For latest FastAPI/Pydantic/SQLAlchemy APIs, use context7.**

## Core Philosophy

Separate **business domain** from **infrastructure**. Domain defines *what*; adapters decide *how*.

```
[Inbound Adapter: FastAPI router] → [Port: Service Protocol] → [Domain Logic]
    → [Port: Repository Protocol] → [Outbound Adapter: SQLAlchemy/Redis/etc.]
```

**Dependencies always point inward.** Domain code never imports FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, or any infrastructure package.

**Rule:** `domain/` never imports from `inbound/` or `outbound/`.

---

## Domain Layer

### Models
- Validate on construction (value object pattern). Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`.
- **No ORM models in domain** — SQLAlchemy models live in `outbound/` only.
- Domain models may use Pydantic for validation, but MUST NOT use `from_attributes=True`.
- Separate `CreateAuthorRequest` from `Author` — they WILL diverge as app grows.

### Errors
- Exhaustive hierarchy: one class per business rule violation + generic `UnknownAuthorError`.
- **Never raise `HTTPException` in domain** — that leaks transport concerns. Use domain error classes; map to HTTP responses in the inbound layer.

### Ports (Protocols)

Use `typing.Protocol` for structural subtyping — no inheritance required from implementors.

Three categories: **Repository** (data), **Metrics** (observability), **Notifier** (side effects).

### Service
- `Protocol` declaring business API + class `AuthorServiceImpl` implementing it.
- Orchestrates: repo → metrics → notifications → return result.
- Handlers call Service, never Repository directly.
- **Evolution path:** Direct calls (repo → metrics → notifier) keep the flow visible in one place — good for simple apps. As side effects grow, the service has to know about every consequence, raising coupling. When this becomes a pain, refactor to domain events: the service emits `AuthorCreatedEvent`, independent handlers react. Adding a new side effect no longer requires touching the service. Trade-off: flow is spread across files, harder to trace.

---

## Inbound Layer

- **Shell class** — wraps FastAPI + uvicorn so `main.py` never imports them.
  Expose `build_test_app()` for tests — returns ASGI app without uvicorn.
- **Use `lifespan` context manager**, not deprecated `@app.on_event`.
- **DI via lifespan state** — `yield {"author_service": service}` → `request.state.author_service`.
  Uses ASGI spec `request.state` — framework-agnostic.
- **Handlers** do three things only: parse input → call service → map response. No SQL. No ORM.
- **Request types** decoupled from domain — `try_into_domain()` validates into domain type.
- **Response types** built via `from_domain()` classmethod — never expose domain models directly.
- **API errors** mapped via `@app.exception_handler`. Never leak domain strings to users.
  `UnknownAuthorError` → log server-side, return generic message. Use RFC 9457 ProblemDetails, served as `application/problem+json` with an `instance` member. 422s populate the `errors` array (`[{field, code, message}]`).
- **Routes mounted under `/v1/`** — author routes at `/v1/authors`. 201 responses set a `Location` header.
- **API docs** — use Pydantic models for request/response definition. FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI docs at `/docs`. Consult `references/api-design.md` for conventions and `references/api-patterns.md` for HTTP patterns.
- **Middleware** — lives in inbound layer, invisible to domain.
  **CORS middleware before routers** (order matters). Drive `allow_methods`/`allow_headers`/`allow_credentials` from config — no wildcards.
- **Request-ID middleware** — read/generate `X-Request-Id`, store on `request.state`, echo it in the response header (correlation id lives in the header, not the body).

### Non-HTTP Inbound Adapters

The inbound layer isn't limited to REST API routes. Any external trigger that drives the domain is an inbound adapter:

| Trigger | Examples | Still HTTP? |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Task/Job queue | Cloud Tasks, SQS, Celery | Yes (HTTP callback) or No (consumer) |
| Webhook | Stripe, GitHub, external service callback | Yes |
| Cron/Scheduler | Cloud Scheduler, cron | Yes (HTTP) or No (direct invoke) |
| Event stream | Pub/Sub, Kafka, EventBridge | No (pull/push consumer) |

All follow the same pattern: **parse input → call service → respond.**

Key differences from REST routes:
- Verify caller identity (task queue headers, webhook signatures) instead of user auth.
- Return simple ack (200 OK) — no user-facing response body.
- Must be idempotent — task queues retry on failure.
- Register in Shell alongside REST routes.

```
src/inbound/
├── http/            # User-facing REST API
├── tasks/           # Task queue handlers
└── webhooks/        # External service callbacks
```

All three are wired into the same Shell. Domain doesn't know which triggered it.

---

## Outbound Layer

- **Repository takes an `AsyncSession`** (`__init__(self, session)`) — don't let `AuthorRepository` create its own engine/session in `__init__`. A supplied session is what lets a `UnitOfWork` share one transaction across repos.
- Expose `from_engine()` for standalone wiring (bootstrap, tests) — it wraps each call in its own short-lived session + transaction.
- **Transactions encapsulated in adapter** (or the UoW), invisible to callers.
- Keep transactions short. **No external calls (HTTP, queues) inside tx.**
- Map DB-specific errors (e.g. `IntegrityError`) to domain error types.
- ORM models live in `outbound/`. Use explicit mapper (`AuthorMapper.to_domain()`) to translate.
  For raw SQL adapters, inline mapping is fine.

→ Full outbound examples (Postgres/SQLite adapters, ORM mapper): `references/examples-adapters.md`

### Async Safety (Critical)

```python
# ❌ Blocks entire event loop
async def bad():
    time.sleep(5)          # blocks!
    requests.get(...)      # sync HTTP!

# ✅ Proper async
async def good():
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        await client.get(...)
```

**Rule: In async routes, ALL I/O must be async. For sync libs, use `def` (thread pool).**

### SQLAlchemy Async

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `expire_on_commit` | `False` | Prevents detached instance errors |
| Relationship loading | `selectinload()` | Lazy loading fails in async |
| Session scope | Per-request in adapter | Adapter creates/closes session |

### Pool Config

```python
create_async_engine(url, pool_size=10, pool_timeout=3, pool_pre_ping=True)
```

---

## Pagination

List endpoints need pagination. **Default to cursor-based pagination.** The pattern flows through all three layers:
- **Domain port**: `list_authors(cursor: str | None, limit: int) -> CursorPage[Author]`
- **Outbound adapter**: `WHERE (created_at, id) > (:cursor) ORDER BY created_at, id LIMIT :limit`
- **Inbound handler**: return `CursorPageResponse[T]` — `{ "data": [...], "meta": { "limit", "next_cursor", "has_more" } }` (pagination nested under `meta`)

Cap `limit` at the handler level (e.g. `Query(20, ge=1, le=100)`). The domain doesn't care about max page size — that's a transport concern.

### Cursor vs Offset

**Cursor** (default) — `WHERE (created_at, id) > (:cursor) ORDER BY created_at, id LIMIT :limit`.
Consistent performance regardless of dataset size. Ideal for feeds, timelines, and large/mutable data. Always use a **composite cursor** `(sort_field, id)`. Cursor is an opaque base64-encoded string in the API; decode in the adapter only.

**Offset** — `OFFSET` / `LIMIT` + `COUNT(*)`.
Use for admin panels and small/static datasets. Provides `total` count for page number UIs. Downside: deeper pages get slower, and row mutations between requests cause duplicates or skips.

---

## Healthcheck

Healthcheck endpoints are infrastructure — they bypass the domain entirely. Wire them directly in Shell.

- `/healthz` — always returns 200 (liveness, "is the process alive?"). **Never check dependencies here** — a liveness probe that touches a flaky DB cascade-restarts every replica.
- `/readyz` — checks DB connectivity (readiness, "can it serve traffic?"). Returns **503** (not 500) when the DB is unreachable, so the load balancer stops routing traffic. `pool_timeout` bounds the probe — a hung DB fails fast instead of stalling the prober.
- Health routes bypass auth — they're wired directly in Shell, before any auth dependency.

The healthcheck needs the engine. Thread it explicitly: bootstrap creates the engine and passes it into `Shell(config, service, engine=...)`; `_build_app`/`build_test_app` accept it and call `app.include_router(health_routes(engine))`.

> Healthcheck example: `references/examples-adapters.md`

---

## Migrations (Alembic)

Migrations are infrastructure. They sit alongside the app, not inside any hex layer. Alembic reads ORM metadata from `outbound/` models to generate migrations.

```
src/alembic/
├── env.py          # Reads Base.metadata from outbound/postgres/models.py
└── versions/       # Generated migration files
```

Use async engine in `env.py` since the app is async throughout.

> Full Alembic setup (env.py, commands): `references/examples-bootstrap.md`

---

## Logging

Use stdlib `logging` throughout. Each module gets its own logger via `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

- **Domain**: log business events at INFO, wrap unexpected exceptions at ERROR
- **Inbound**: exception handlers log server errors before returning generic messages
- **Outbound**: log DB errors, slow queries

For structured logging (JSON output), add `structlog` and configure it once in `main.py`. The domain code stays the same — `structlog` wraps stdlib loggers.

---

## App Orchestrator

For apps with background workers, use `Application` class with `asyncio.TaskGroup`.
`TaskGroup` cancels sibling tasks on failure. HTTP-only apps can skip this.
Ensure `engine.dispose()` in a `finally` block for clean shutdown.

---

## Security

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Password hashing | `pwdlib[argon2]` (default), `bcrypt` (fallback) |
| JWT library | `PyJWT` (not python-jose, which is unmaintained) |
| JWT access token | 15 min |
| JWT refresh (web) | 90 days |
| JWT refresh (mobile) | 1 year |
| Refresh token rotation | **Required** — issue new refresh token on each use, revoke old immediately |
| Refresh token storage | DB table with `jti`, `user_id`, `revoked_at`, `expires_at` |
| Timestamps | `datetime.now(UTC)` (not deprecated `utcnow()`) |
| CORS | Explicit origins, methods, headers from config (no wildcard); set `allow_credentials` explicitly |
| JWT signing | **ES256/EdDSA** (asymmetric) for multi-service user-facing auth; `HS256` only as a labeled single-service/dev fallback |
| Security headers | No ASGI helmet equivalent — set HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` in one small middleware (or the `secure` package) |
| Rate limiting | Terminate at the gateway/LB; if enforced in-process, emit the 429 as `application/problem+json` like every other error |

Auth dependency (`get_current_user`) lives in inbound layer. Domain never handles raw tokens. Never sign tokens with the dev placeholder secret — require a real `SECRET_KEY` from the environment in every non-dev deployment.

---

## Bootstrap (main.py)

Construct adapters → assemble service → start. **No FastAPI/SQLAlchemy imports.**

Package management: `uv`. Commit `uv.lock`. Use `uv run` to execute.

Shutdown: uvicorn traps SIGINT/SIGTERM and runs the lifespan shutdown — `engine.dispose()` belongs there (or in the Application orchestrator's `finally`). Set `timeout_graceful_shutdown` so a hung request can't stall the drain.

→ Full bootstrap, Application orchestrator, Alembic setup, and CI examples: `references/examples-bootstrap.md`

---

## Domain Boundaries

1. **Domain = tangible arm of your business** (blogging, billing, identity)
2. **Entities that change atomically → same domain**
3. **Cross-domain operations are never atomic** — service calls or async events
4. **Start large, decompose when friction is observed**

> If you leak transactions into business logic for cross-domain atomicity, your boundaries are wrong.

---

## Enforce the Boundary (CI)

"Domain never imports infrastructure" is a fitness function, not an honor system — Python's import system won't stop anyone; `import-linter` will (if the `software-architecture` skill is installed, this is its Stage-8 fitness functions at code level):

```ini
# .importlinter
[importlinter]
root_package = src

[importlinter:contract:layers]
name = Hexagonal layers
type = layers
layers =
    src.inbound : src.outbound
    src.domain
```

`domain` is the bottom layer (imports nothing above it); `inbound : outbound` are independent siblings. Run `lint-imports` in CI next to `ruff check`, `pyright`/`mypy`, and `pytest`.

Cross-cutting infrastructure that must not leak into the domain. Define each as a `Protocol`; implement as adapters. The architecture-level pattern lives in the software-architecture skill's references (`reliability-patterns.md`, `observability.md`) if installed; otherwise apply the standard patterns inline — outbox, idempotency keys, retry/backoff, structured logging, RED/USE.

| Port | Purpose | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **UnitOfWork** | Scopes a transaction across multiple repositories so the aggregate write and the outbox write share one `AsyncSession` | Outbound; entered by application service |
| **IdempotencyStore** | Replay safe responses for `Idempotency-Key`-bearing requests | Outbound; called by inbound middleware or application service |
| **Tracer** / **Meter** | OTel span / metric emission. Domain depends on the `Protocol`, not on `opentelemetry` packages | Outbound (OTel adapter); no-op for tests |

**Architectural rule**: domain emits **`DomainEvent`** dataclasses; the application service opens a UnitOfWork (`async with uow:`) and calls both the aggregate repo and the outbox repo inside it. Same `AsyncSession` = same transaction. A separate **outbox relay** worker (background task or separate process) publishes rows asynchronously.

**Why UnitOfWork instead of letting each repo create its own session?** SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession` *is* the unit of work. If two repos own two different sessions, you're back to dual writes. UoW makes the shared session explicit and the tx boundary visible at the call site.

**Optimistic concurrency (lost-update protection)**: any aggregate two clients can update concurrently carries a `version` column. With the ORM, set `version_id_col` on the mapper — flushes emit `WHERE version = :expected` and raise `StaleDataError` on a miss; map that to a domain conflict error in the adapter. Raw-SQL adapters: conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE id = :id AND version = :v` + check `rowcount`. Surface as **409** (or **412** with `If-Match`/ETag, per `api-design.md`). Idempotency keys cover the *same* client retrying; the version column covers *different* clients racing — you usually need both.

## Common Gotchas

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 422 Unprocessable | Schema mismatch | Test in `/docs` first |
| CORS not working | Middleware order | Add CORS before routers |
| All requests hang | Blocking in async | No `time.sleep()`, use `await` |
| "Field required" | Optional without default | `str \| None = None` |
| Detached instance | Session closed | `expire_on_commit=False` |
| Lazy load error | Async SQLAlchemy | Use `selectinload()` |
| Domain imports FastAPI | Leaky boundary | Move to inbound layer |
| HTTPException in domain | Transport leak | Use domain error classes |
| ORM model in handler | Missing mapper | Translate in adapter via mapper |
| `utcnow()` deprecation | Python 3.12+ | Use `datetime.now(UTC)` |
| jose/passlib issues | Unmaintained deps | Use `PyJWT` + `pwdlib[argon2]` (bcrypt fallback) |
