## Model Overview

| Model | Median Growth | NRR Potential | Revenue Predictability | Ease of Selling |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Seat-based | 15% | 105-110% | High | Easy |
| Usage-based | 18% | 115-130% | Low | Medium |
| Outcome-based | Emerging | Very high | Low | Hard |
| **Hybrid** | **21%** | **110-125%** | **Medium-High** | **Medium** |
| Credit-based | 19% | 110-120% | Medium-High | Medium |

**Key insight**: companies using hybrid models report the highest median growth rate and 34% higher LTV/CAC ratios. 86% of SaaS companies valued above $100M employ at least three dimensions in their pricing.

## Seat-Based Pricing

**Charge per user** who has access to the product. The most familiar model — Salesforce, Slack, Notion built massive businesses on it.

### Strengths

- **Simple to understand** — buyers can model costs; CFOs can forecast budgets
- **Predictable revenue** — easy to forecast ARR
- **Scales with organization size** — as companies hire, they buy more seats
- **Easy for sales teams** — "How many users do you need?" is a simple conversation

### Weaknesses

- **Caps expansion** when only a subset of users derive value — paying for seats nobody uses
- **Encourages seat sharing** and password sharing to save money
- **Doesn't scale with value** — a power user pays the same as someone who logs in once a month
- **Discourages adoption** — managers hesitate to add users because each one costs money

### When to Use

- Team collaboration tools where value genuinely scales with headcount
- Products where every user gets comparable value
- Markets where per-seat is the expected model (e.g., CRM, project management)
- When you need simple, predictable pricing in early stages

### Diagnostic Signal

If customers regularly ask "Do all these users really need access?" or if seat utilization is below 60%, the pricing model is misaligned with value delivery. Consider switching to a different metric or layering usage-based components.

### The Evolution of Seats

Seats are not dying, but they're evolving. Leading companies now use seats as a gateway, then layer consumption, credits, or outcome dimensions on top:

- **Seat + usage cap**: Notion charges per member, AI features have usage limits
- **Seat + feature tier**: Basic vs. Pro seats at different prices
- **Seat + consumption overage**: Base seats included, then pay-per-use above threshold

---

## Usage-Based Pricing

**Charge based on consumption** — API calls, transactions, storage, compute, messages, events. Now used by 61% of SaaS companies in some form.

### Strengths

- **Aligns price with value** — customers pay proportional to what they use
- **Low barrier to entry** — start small, grow naturally
- **Natural expansion loop** — revenue grows as customers succeed (130%+ NRR achievable)
- **Fair** — light users pay less; power users pay more
- **Attracts experimentation** — customers try with low commitment

### Weaknesses

- **Revenue unpredictability** — hard to forecast; usage can fluctuate or churn suddenly
- **Longer sales cycles** — 29% longer on average because enterprise buyers want budget certainty
- **Complex billing** — metering, invoicing, overage handling add engineering burden
- **Bill shock risk** — unexpected spikes in usage lead to surprise bills and churn

### Key Insight: Predictability Beats Price

Enterprise buyers prioritize budget certainty over getting the cheapest deal. Many will pay *more* for a predictable monthly bill than for a usage-based model that might be cheaper on average. This is why hybrid and credit models outperform pure usage-based.

### Implementation Patterns

**Pay-as-you-go**: Pure consumption, no commitment. Best for APIs and infrastructure (Twilio, AWS Lambda).

**Committed use with overages**: Base commitment + pay-per-use above threshold. Provides predictability while retaining usage alignment.

**Tiered volume pricing**: Price per unit decreases at higher volumes (e.g., $0.01/call for first 100K, $0.005/call above). Rewards growth.

### When to Use

- API and infrastructure products
- Products with highly variable consumption patterns
- When your value metric is naturally quantifiable (messages sent, GB stored, API calls)
- When you want natural expansion revenue without upsell friction

---

## Outcome-Based Pricing

**Charge based on measurable business results** — tickets resolved, revenue generated, leads qualified, deals closed. The most value-aligned model, but the hardest to implement.

### Current Adoption

Only ~9% of SaaS companies have fully implemented outcome-based pricing, but 47% are actively exploring or piloting. Gartner projects 30%+ adoption by 2025-2026.

### Strengths

- **Maximum value alignment** — you only make money when the customer does
- **Builds trust** — eliminates "am I getting value?" doubt
- **Higher willingness to pay** — customers pay more when tied to results
- **Strong retention** — customers who see measurable ROI don't churn

### Challenges

- **Attribution complexity** — proving your product caused the outcome
- **Variable revenue** — outcomes depend on factors beyond your control
- **Customer reporting risk** — incentive to underreport or game metrics
- **Operational complexity** — requires robust measurement and billing infrastructure
- **Long measurement cycles** — some outcomes take months to materialize

### Implementation Approaches

| Approach | Example | Complexity |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Per-resolution** | $0.70 per resolved support ticket | Low |
| **Revenue share** | 5-10% of incremental revenue generated | Medium |
| **Cost savings share** | 15% of costs reduced | Medium |
| **Per-qualified-outcome** | $5 per qualified lead | Low |
| **Guarantee-based** | Money-back if KPI not met | High |

### When to Use

- AI agents that perform autonomous work (support, sales, data processing)
- Products with easily measurable ROI (e.g., ad platforms, conversion tools)
- Markets where customers are skeptical of SaaS value
- When you can reliably measure and attribute outcomes
- When competitive pressure demands skin-in-the-game pricing

## Hybrid Models (The Winner)

**Combine subscription base with usage/consumption components.** The data consistently shows hybrid outperforms pure models.

### Why Hybrid Wins

| Benefit | How Hybrid Delivers |
|---------|-------------------|
| Revenue predictability | Subscription base provides floor |
| Expansion revenue | Usage component grows with customer success |
| Low entry barrier | Start with base subscription, grow into usage |
| Value alignment | Consumption scales with actual value |
| Budget certainty | Customers know the minimum; overages are proportional |

### Common Hybrid Patterns

**Platform fee + usage overages**:
```
Base: $99/mo (includes 10K API calls, 5 seats)
Overage: $0.005/call above 10K, $15/additional seat
```

**Tiered subscription + metered features**:
```
Starter: $29/mo (core features)
Pro: $79/mo (core + advanced) + $0.10/AI credit used
Enterprise: Custom base + negotiated usage rates
```

**Seat-based + consumption add-ons**:
```
Per seat: $15/user/mo
AI features: $10/mo per 100 credits
Premium support: $50/mo flat add-on
```

### Design Principles

1. The subscription base should cover your cost to serve + margin floor
2. Usage pricing should align with the customer's highest-value activities
3. Overage pricing should feel fair, not punitive — gradual scaling, not cliff pricing
4. Customers should be able to predict 80%+ of their bill from the base subscription
5. The expansion path should feel natural: "I'm using more because it's working"

---

## Credit-Based Models

**Pre-purchased units of work** that can be spent across different product features. The defining pricing trend of 2025-2026 — 126% YoY growth in adoption among top SaaS companies.

### Why Credits Are Exploding

Credits solve the core tension in AI/SaaS pricing: **customers want budget predictability; vendors want revenue that scales with value.**

| Dimension | Credits Deliver |
|-----------|----------------|
| Customer predictability | Pre-purchased, known cost upfront |
| Vendor value alignment | Credits consumed = value delivered |
| Flexibility | One currency across multiple features |
| Upsell path | Run out of credits → buy more |
| Margin protection | Vendor sets credit exchange rates |

### How Credits Work

1. Customer buys a credit package (e.g., 1,000 credits/month for $99)
2. Different actions cost different amounts of credits:
   - Simple query: 1 credit
   - Complex analysis: 10 credits
   - Document generation: 5 credits
   - Image generation: 20 credits
3. Customer monitors credit usage and buys more or upgrades tier as needed

### Credit Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Rollover | Credits expire monthly vs. roll over | Roll over (reduces churn from "wasted credits") |
| Overage | Hard cap vs. pay-per-credit overage | Pay-per-credit overage (prevents workflow interruption) |
| Visibility | Hidden metering vs. transparent dashboard | Always transparent — build trust |
| Pooling | Per-user vs. shared pool | Shared pool for teams (simpler, more flexible) |

### Examples

- **HubSpot**: Marketing email credits per plan tier
- **Figma**: AI credits for FigJam and design features
- **Salesforce**: Einstein AI credits across platform features
- **Vercel**: Serverless function execution credits
- **Notion**: AI credits integrated into workspace plans

## AI / LLM Product Pricing

### Three Packaging Options for AI Features

When adding AI capabilities to an existing product (a16z framework):

| Option | When to Use | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Bundle into core** | All customers benefit; AI is mission-critical | Notion AI bundled into plans (raised base price $2.50-$5/user) |
| **Premium tier upgrade** | AI differentiates premium segments | Move AI features to Pro/Business tier |
| **Standalone add-on** | Small set of customers; need to manage margin impact | GitHub Copilot as $19/mo add-on |

### AI API Pricing

Token-based pricing is standard for LLM APIs. Key dynamics:

- **Massive price deflation**: GPT-4o mini at $0.15/$0.60 per million tokens — costs dropping 50%+ annually
- **Input vs. output tokens**: Most APIs price output tokens 3-4x higher than input tokens
- **Caching discounts**: Cached/prompt tokens at 50-75% discount
- **Cost may surpass performance as chief competitive factor** by 2026 (Gartner)

### The Subscription Problem for AI

Per-seat pricing for AI features creates a perverse incentive: you're hoping customers don't use your product heavily, because power users cost more to serve (compute) but pay the same as light users. This is why seat-based pricing is evolving toward seat + credits or seat + usage caps.

### Pricing AI Features: Decision Flow

1. Is AI the core product or an add-on feature?
   - **Core**: Price the whole product around AI value (credits or usage)
   - **Add-on**: Bundle, upgrade tier, or standalone (see table above)

2. Is consumption variable across users?
   - **Highly variable**: Credits or usage-based
   - **Roughly uniform**: Can include in seat price

3. Are costs stable or declining rapidly?
   - **Declining**: Start higher, plan to reduce (skim pricing) or expand included usage
   - **Stable**: Set sustainable price points

## Agentic AI Pricing

The most disruptive pricing shift. Agentic AI acts autonomously and renders "cost per seat" meaningless — there's no human "user" to charge per seat.

### The Core Shift

**From charging for access to software → charging for work delivered.**

Traditional SaaS: "Pay for the right to use the tool."
Agentic AI: "Pay for tasks completed, problems solved, results achieved."

### Pricing Models for AI Agents

| Model | How It Works | Example | Best For |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Per-task** | Fixed fee per completed task | $0.70/resolved ticket | Repeatable, defined tasks |
| **Per-outcome** | Fee tied to business result | 10% of revenue generated | Measurable business impact |
| **Per-workflow** | Fee per workflow automated | $5/onboarding completed | Multi-step processes |
| **Credit-based** | Agent actions consume credits | 50 credits/agent run | Variable complexity tasks |
| **Hybrid seat + agent** | Human seats + agent consumption | $15/user + $0.50/agent task | Teams augmented by agents |

### Bessemer's AI Business Model Framework

| AI Type | Description | Pricing Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Copilots** | Human-in-the-loop assistance | Per seat + usage caps or credits |
| **Agents** | Autonomous task completion | Per task/outcome |
| **AI-enabled Services** | Full workflow replacement | Outcome-based, tied to business results |

### Pricing Agentic AI: Key Principles

1. **Price the outcome, not the compute** — customers don't care about tokens consumed; they care about tasks completed
2. **Build in quality gates** — only charge for successfully completed work (e.g., resolved tickets, not attempted tickets)
3. **Offer cost ceilings** — monthly caps or committed pricing to give enterprise buyers budget certainty
4. **Start simple** — per-task pricing is easiest to explain and implement; outcome-based can come later as trust builds
5. **Measure everything** — you need robust analytics to prove value and justify pricing

### Timeline

Standard practices for agentic AI pricing may take years to emerge. Gartner predicts by 2030, 40%+ of enterprise SaaS spend shifts to usage-, agent-, or outcome-based models. For now, experimentation is expected and accepted.

## Model Selection Decision Tree

### Start Here

**1. What does your product do?**

- **Team collaboration / workflow tool** → Start with **seat-based**, layer usage for expansion
- **API / infrastructure / developer tool** → **Usage-based** or **credit-based**
- **AI copilot (augments human work)** → **Seat + credits**
- **AI agent (autonomous work)** → **Per-task** or **per-outcome**
- **Complex platform with multiple use cases** → **Hybrid** (subscription + usage + add-ons)

**2. What do your customers expect?**

- Enterprise buyers wanting budget certainty → Include subscription base or committed pricing
- Developers wanting to start free → Usage-based with generous free tier
- SMBs wanting simplicity → Simple tiers with clear differentiation
- PLG motion → Freemium or free trial with usage-based expansion

**3. What does your cost structure look like?**

- High marginal cost per user/usage (AI, compute) → Usage or credit-based to protect margins
- Low marginal cost (software only) → Seat-based or flat rate is fine
- Variable costs by feature → Credit-based (different credit costs per feature)

### If You're Unsure

Default to **hybrid**: subscription base + one usage-based component. It's the statistically safest choice — highest growth, best LTV/CAC, and you can always adjust the ratio between base and usage.

## Flat Rate & Other Models

### Flat Rate Pricing

**One price for everything.** Simple but limited.

- **When it works**: Very simple products, single-persona companies, early-stage MVPs
- **When it fails**: Any product with meaningfully different customer segments or usage patterns
- **The problem**: No upsell path, no expansion revenue, subsidizes power users at the expense of light users

### Freemium (as a Model, Not Just an Acquisition Channel)

See `references/tier-packaging.md` for full freemium strategy.

Core principle: freemium is an **acquisition model**, not a revenue model. The free tier exists to acquire users who will eventually convert to paid.

### Per-Feature Pricing (Add-Ons)

Charge separately for distinct modules or capabilities:

- Works when features serve different personas or use cases
- Each add-on should be independently valuable
- Avoid "nickel-and-diming" — if customers need 3+ add-ons to get full value, bundle them into a tier

### Marketplace / Transaction-Based

Take a percentage of transactions processed through your platform:

- Standard in marketplace platforms (Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30, Shopify: 2% on basic plan)
- Aligns vendor success with customer success
- Requires significant transaction volume to generate meaningful revenue
