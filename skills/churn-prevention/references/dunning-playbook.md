## The Dunning Stack

```
Pre-dunning → Smart retry → Dunning emails → Grace period → Hard cancel
```

Failed payments cause roughly 20-40% of all churn (industry estimates, Recurly/Zuora) but are the most recoverable.

---

## Pre-Dunning (Prevent Failures)

- **Card expiry alerts**: Email 30, 15, and 7 days before card expires
- **Backup payment method**: Prompt for a second payment method at signup
- **Network tokens** (Visa Token Service, Mastercard MDES, Amex tokenization): the network keeps the token's underlying card-on-file current when the issuer reissues or re-numbers a card (new PAN/expiry) — covering expired, reissued, AND lost/stolen-then-reissued cards, so stored credentials self-heal with no customer action. Network tokens **complement, they do NOT replace,** the older Account Updater batch programs (Visa VAU / Mastercard ABU): issuer/processor participation in token programs is still incomplete, and you need an up-to-date underlying PAN to fall back to — mature billing stacks run **both**. Stripe requests network tokens automatically for Stripe Payments accounts (out of the box); Adyen, Braintree, and Checkout.com also provision tokens for stored cards. Typical impact: ~2-7 percentage-point CNP authorization-rate lift (Visa cites ~4.6%, Mastercard ~2.1%) and a meaningful cut in card-credential-staleness declines. (Does not recover a permanently closed account with no replacement card.)
- **Pre-billing notification**: Email 3-5 days before charge for annual plans

## Smart Retry Logic

Not all failures are the same:

| Decline Type | Examples | Retry Strategy |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Soft decline (temporary) | Insufficient funds, processor timeout | ML-driven retry (Stripe Smart Retries, Adyen Auto Rescue) or static 3-5 retries over 7-10 days |
| Hard decline (permanent) | Account closed, card reported lost/stolen with no reissue | Don't retry the failed card — request a new card (a *reissued* card is auto-followed by network tokens / Account Updater) |
| Authentication required (SCA) | 3D Secure 2 challenge required | Send customer to update payment via authenticated flow — automatic retries fail without consumer challenge |

### Retry Timing — Prefer ML over Static Schedule

Static schedule (**soft declines only** — hard declines skip retries and go straight to a card-update request):
- Retry 1: 24 hours after failure (day 1)
- Retry 2: day 3
- Retry 3: day 5
- Retry 4: day 7 (with dunning email escalation)
- Grace period through day 10, then hard cancel with reactivation path

The terminal hard-cancel (day 10) lands **after** the final dunning email (day 10), so the retry track and the email track below stay on one clock. **Trigger dunning emails off retry/billing-state events** (e.g., "retry 3 failed", "entering grace", "grace expired → cancel"), not a fixed calendar, so the two never drift.

**ML-driven retry (preferred for >$10k MRR):** Stripe Smart Retries (within Stripe Billing), Stripe Authorization Boost (across Stripe, which includes Adaptive Acceptance), Adyen Auto Rescue (part of RevenueAccelerate), or churn-recovery tools (Churnkey, Baremetrics Recover, Stunning) pick retry timing per card / per issuer / per failure code. Lifts recovery 10-30% over static schedules in industry benchmarks.

### SCA / 3DS notes (EU enforced end-2020 through 2021, phased by country; UK fully enforced from 14 March 2022)

> Not legal/payments advice — verify current requirements with your billing provider and against current law per region.

- Failed retries on SCA-required transactions don't recover without explicit consumer authentication
- Bring the customer back **on-session** to an authenticated card-update flow — Stripe's Payment Element / Checkout render and complete the 3DS challenge automatically once the customer is present (when integrated via Setup/Payment Intents), but the off-session → on-session hand-off (detecting `requires_payment_method` / authentication-required, then notifying and routing the customer back) is merchant integration work, not automatic
- Excluding low-value or recurring exemptions is provider-specific — verify with your billing provider

## Dunning Email Sequence

This email track shares the same day-0 to day-10 clock as the retry/grace schedule in § Smart Retry Logic above — both are triggered off billing-state events (not the calendar), so the two tracks never drift.

| Email | Timing | Tone | Content |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Day 0 (failure) | Friendly alert | "Your payment didn't go through. Update your card." |
| 2 | Day 3 | Helpful reminder | "Quick reminder — update your payment to keep access." |
| 3 | Day 7 | Urgency | "Your account will be paused in 3 days. Update now." |
| 4 | Day 10 | Final warning | "Last chance to keep your account active." |

(Timings track the retry/grace schedule above — Email 4 lands the same day grace expires, just before hard cancel.)

### Email Best Practices
- Direct link to payment update page (no login required if possible)
- Show what they'll lose (their data, their team's access)
- Don't blame ("your payment failed" not "you failed to pay")
- Include support contact for help
- Plain text performs better than designed emails for dunning

## Recovery Benchmarks

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Soft decline recovery | <40% | 50-60% | 70%+ |
| Hard decline recovery\* | <10% | 20-30% | 40%+ |
| Overall payment recovery | <30% | 40-50% | 60%+ |
| Pre-dunning prevention | None | 10-15% | 20-30% |
| Dispute / chargeback rate (guardrail) | above network threshold | — | well under threshold |

\* Hard-decline recovery comes from card-update prompts and network token / Account Updater refreshes (see Pre-Dunning), **not** from retrying the failed card — retrying hard declines wastes retry budget and inflates disputes. Tune recovery against the dispute-rate guardrail, not gross recovery alone.

---

## Chargeback / Dispute Risk

Recovery tactics optimize gross revenue, but retry aggressiveness directly drives cardholder disputes:

- Retrying unfamiliar or disputed charges (and retrying hard declines) raises chargebacks
- Excessive dispute rates trigger card-network monitoring programs (Visa VDMP, Mastercard Excessive Chargeback) that carry fines and merchant-account jeopardy
- Keep dispute rate well under the network threshold (commonly ~0.65-0.9% depending on program — verify current values with your processor)
- Track dispute rate as a **guardrail** alongside recovery rate; tune retry cadence against disputes, not just gross recovery

## Billing Provider Capabilities

| Provider | Smart Retries | Dunning Emails | Card Updater |
|----------|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| **Stripe** | Built-in (Smart Retries) | Built-in | Automatic |
| **Chargebee** | Built-in | Built-in | Via gateway |
| **Paddle** | Built-in (Paddle Retain — algorithmic "Tactical Retries") | Built-in (Paddle Retain — email + SMS + in-app) | Managed (MoR) |
| **Recurly** | Built-in | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Braintree** | Manual config | Manual | Via gateway |

Paddle Retain (formerly ProfitWell Retain, acquired by Paddle in 2022) is Paddle's named, algorithm-driven recovery product. Because Paddle is the merchant of record, it owns the payment relationship and card-on-file on the seller's behalf — which is why card updating is "Managed" rather than gateway-dependent.
