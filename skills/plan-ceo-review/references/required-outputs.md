# Required Outputs

Loaded by `plan-ceo-review`. Produce all that apply. Each is mandatory regardless of whether issues were found (the question escape-hatch governs AskUserQuestion calls, not deliverables).

## "NOT in scope" section
Work considered and explicitly deferred, with a one-line rationale each.

## "What already exists" section
Existing code/flows that partially solve sub-problems and whether the plan reuses them.

## "Dream state delta" section
Where this plan leaves us relative to the 12-month ideal (from Step 0C).

## Error & Rescue Registry (from Section 2)
Complete table of every method that can fail, every exception class, rescued status, rescue action, user impact.

## Failure Modes Registry
```
  CODEPATH | FAILURE MODE   | RESCUED? | TEST? | USER SEES?     | LOGGED?
  ---------|----------------|----------|-------|----------------|--------
```
**Any row with RESCUED=N AND TEST=N AND USER SEES=Silent → CRITICAL GAP.** (This deterministic gate is the load-bearing output — never soften it.)

## tasks/board.md updates
This skill does **not** write the board itself — it only proposes; with no write tools pinned, it cannot place rows even by accident. After the user approves a task, hand it to the caller's task-capture capability (`task-add`, if available — the canonical appender), which owns ID assignment, grouping, and schema conformance. Row + detail shape are defined by `task-craft/references/board-schema.md` (canonical):
* Board row is 8 columns: `| id | feature | task | type | priority | status | assignee | touches |`.
* `type` ∈ `feature | bugfix | refactor | chore | spike | hotfix`.
* `priority` is lowercase `high | medium | low` (NOT `P0/P1/P2/P3`). high = blocking/critical-this-cycle; medium = important not urgent; low = nice-to-have.
* `status` lifecycle (`backlog → active → blocked → done`) is owned by the `task-status` skill — do not hand-maintain a "Completed" section.

Present each potential task as its own individual AskUserQuestion (never batch tasks — one per question; never silently skip this step). For each, describe:
* **What:** one-line description of the work.
* **Why:** the concrete problem solved or value unlocked.
* **Pros / Cons:** what you gain; cost, complexity, risk.
* **Context:** enough that someone picking this up in 3 months understands the motivation, current state, and where to start.
* **Type:** `feature | bugfix | refactor | chore | spike | hotfix`
* **Effort:** S / M / L / XL (the task-capture capability splits L/XL proposals into session-sized tasks)
* **Priority:** `high | medium | low`
* **Touches:** comma-separated file/dir paths the task creates or modifies (required — used for conflict detection).
* **Depends on:** prerequisites or ordering constraints, or "None".

Then present options (recommended first): **Hand off** to the task-capture capability (`task-add`) to append the row · **Skip** — not valuable enough · **Promote** into the current scope and review it now (still no code). (No A/B/C letters on the option cards — lettering is report-text only.)

The matching `tasks/features/{feature}.md` detail (written by `task-add`) follows task-craft's format: `### T-NNN` then `phase`, `priority` (high/medium/low), `depends_on`, `touches`, `context`, `acceptance`.

## Delight Opportunities (EXPANSION mode only)
Identify at least 5 "bonus chunk" opportunities (<30 min each) that would make users think "oh nice, they thought of that." Present each as its own individual AskUserQuestion (never batch). For each: what it is, why it would delight, effort estimate. Options: **Hand off** to the task-capture capability as a vision item · **Skip** · **Promote** into the current scope and review it now (still no code).

## Diagrams (mandatory, produce all that apply)
1. System architecture · 2. Data flow (including shadow paths) · 3. State machine · 4. Error flow · 5. Deployment sequence · 6. Rollback flowchart.

## Stale Diagram Audit
List every ASCII diagram in files this plan touches. Still accurate?

## Unresolved Decisions
If any AskUserQuestion goes unanswered (including non-interactive `UNRESOLVED-AUTO` deferrals), list it here. Never silently default.
