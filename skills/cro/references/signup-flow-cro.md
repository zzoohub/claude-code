# Signup Flow CRO

Reduce friction in signup and registration flows, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Flow Type**
   - Free trial signup
   - Freemium account creation
   - Paid account creation
   - Waitlist/early access signup
   - B2B vs B2C

2. **Current State**
   - How many steps/screens?
   - What fields are required?
   - What's the current completion rate?
   - Where do users drop off?

3. **Business Constraints**
   - What data is genuinely needed at signup?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - What happens immediately after signup?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimize Required Fields
Every field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:
- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?
- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?
- Can we infer this from other data?

**Typical field priority:**
- Essential: Email (or phone), Password
- Often needed: Name
- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address

### 2. Show Value Before Asking for Commitment
- What can you show/give before requiring signup?
- Can they experience the product before creating an account?
- Reverse the order: value first, signup second

### 3. Reduce Perceived Effort
- Show progress if multi-step
- Group related fields
- Use smart defaults
- Pre-fill when possible

### 4. Remove Uncertainty
- Clear expectations ("Takes 30 seconds")
- Show what happens after signup
- No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps)

## Field-by-Field Optimization

### Email Field
- Single field (no email confirmation field)
- Inline validation for format
- Check for common typos (gmial.com -> gmail.com)
- Clear error messages

### Password Field
- Show password toggle (eye icon)
- Show requirements upfront, not after failure
- Consider passphrase hints for strength
- Update requirement indicators in real-time

**Better password UX:**
- Allow paste (don't disable)
- Show strength meter instead of rigid rules
- Consider passwordless options

### Name Field
- Single "Full name" field vs. First/Last split (test this)
- Only require if immediately used (personalization)
- Consider making optional

### Social Auth Options
- Place prominently (often higher conversion than email)
- Show most relevant options for your audience
  - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook
  - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO
- Clear visual separation from email signup
- Consider "Sign up with Google" as primary

### Phone Number
- Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads)
- If required, explain why
- Use proper input type with country code handling
- Format as they type

### Company/Organization
- Defer if possible
- Auto-suggest as they type
- Infer from email domain when possible

### Use Case / Role Questions
- Defer to onboarding if possible
- If needed at signup, keep to one question
- Use progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once)

---

## Single-Step vs. Multi-Step

### Single-Step Works When:
- 3 or fewer fields
- Simple B2C products
- High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist)

### Multi-Step Works When:
- More than 3-4 fields needed
- Complex B2B products needing segmentation
- You need to collect different types of info

### Multi-Step Best Practices
- Show progress indicator
- Lead with easy questions (name, email)
- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)
- Each step should feel completable in seconds
- Allow back navigation
- Save progress (don't lose data on refresh)

**Progressive commitment pattern:**
1. Email only (lowest barrier)
2. Password + name
3. Customization questions (optional)

---

## Trust and Friction Reduction

### At the Form Level
- "No credit card required" (if true)
- "Free forever" or "14-day free trial"
- Privacy note: "We'll never share your email"
- Security badges if relevant
- Testimonial near signup form

### Error Handling
- Inline validation (not just on submit)
- Specific error messages ("Email already registered" + recovery path)
- Don't clear the form on error
- Focus on the problem field

### Microcopy
- Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels
- Labels: Always visible (not just placeholders)
- Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field

---

## Mobile Signup Optimization

- Larger touch targets (44px+ height)
- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.)
- Autofill support
- Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill)
- Single column layout
- Sticky CTA button
- Test with actual devices

---

## Post-Submit Experience

### Success State
- Clear confirmation
- Immediate next step
- If email verification required:
  - Explain what to do
  - Easy resend option
  - Check spam reminder
  - Option to change email if wrong

### Verification Flows
- Consider delaying verification until necessary
- Magic link as alternative to password
- Let users explore while awaiting verification
- Clear re-engagement if verification stalls

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- Form start rate (landed -> started filling)
- Form completion rate (started -> submitted)
- Field-level drop-off (which fields lose people)
- Time to complete
- Error rate by field
- Mobile vs. desktop completion

### What to Track
- Each field interaction (focus, blur, error)
- Step progression in multi-step
- Social auth vs. email signup ratio
- Time between steps

---

## Output Format

### Audit Findings
For each issue found:
- **Issue**: What's wrong
- **Impact**: Why it matters (with estimated impact if possible)
- **Fix**: Specific recommendation
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

### Recommended Changes
Organized by:
1. Quick wins (same-day fixes)
2. High-impact changes (week-level effort)
3. Test hypotheses (things to A/B test)

### Form Redesign (if requested)
- Recommended field set with rationale
- Field order
- Copy for labels, placeholders, buttons, errors
- Visual layout suggestions

## Benchmarks

| Flow Type | Typical Completion Rate | Good | Excellent |
|-----------|------------------------|------|-----------|
| Single-step (email + password) | 40-60% | 60-75% | 75%+ |
| Single-step with social auth | 50-70% | 70-85% | 85%+ |
| Multi-step (3+ screens) | 20-40% | 40-55% | 55%+ |
| B2B with company fields | 15-30% | 30-45% | 45%+ |
| Waitlist (email only) | 60-80% | 80-90% | 90%+ |

Adding social auth typically lifts completion by 20-30% relative. Every additional required field drops completion by roughly 5-10%.

## Before/After Example: B2B SaaS Signup

**Before (high friction):**
```
Create Your Account
[First Name]  [Last Name]
[Work Email]
[Password]  [Confirm Password]
[Company Name]
[Company Size ▼]
[Your Role ▼]
[How did you hear about us? ▼]
[□ I agree to the Terms of Service]
[Create Account]
```
Problems: 9 fields. Confirm password is unnecessary with a show/hide toggle. Company size, role, and attribution can all be collected later. No social auth. No trust signals. Generic CTA.

**After (optimized):**
```
Start your free trial
[Continue with Google]
[Continue with Microsoft]
─── or ───
[Work Email]
[Password 👁]
[Start Free Trial — No Credit Card]
"Join 4,000+ teams. Setup takes 30 seconds."
```
Why it works: Social auth handles 60%+ of signups with zero typing. Only 2 fields for email signup. Trust signals ("No Credit Card", "30 seconds", social proof) directly at the form. Company/role collected during onboarding when the user is already committed.

## Common Signup Flow Patterns

### B2B SaaS Trial
1. Email + Password (or Google auth)
2. Name + Company (optional: role)
3. -> Onboarding flow

### B2C App
1. Google/Apple auth OR Email
2. -> Product experience
3. Profile completion later

### Waitlist/Early Access
1. Email only
2. Optional: Role/use case question
3. -> Waitlist confirmation

### E-commerce Account
1. Guest checkout as default
2. Account creation optional post-purchase
3. OR Social auth with single click

## Experiment Ideas

High-impact areas to test: field count, social auth prominence, single vs. multi-step, CTA copy, trust signals placement, credit card requirement, and post-submit experience. For rigorous experiment design methodology, see `references/experiments.md`.
