  Design a single screen (or modify an existing one) on a product that already
  has an application-level UX. Creates or updates one
  `docs/ux/screens/{screen}.md` with screen purpose, layout, all 7 states,
  interactions, and UX copy. Touches `docs/ux/ux-design.md` ONLY when IA or
  global patterns genuinely change.
  Use when: designing or redesigning one screen on an existing app. Trigger
  phrases: "design the X screen", "redesign the X page", "spec out the X
  modal", "fix the X flow".
  This skill owns structural layout, states, and copy. Do NOT use for: a new
  product's entire app structure (use ux-design — it produces the app-level UX
  plus all initial screens); conversion/funnel-driven flow optimization (use
  cro — it diagnoses the fix, this skill specs the resulting screen);
  animation/motion polish (use motion); visual styling, color palettes, design
  tokens (use design-system); or frontend/UI implementation code.

# Screen Design — Single Screen on Existing App

Designs one screen against an existing app-level UX without rewriting
`docs/ux/ux-design.md`.

## Prerequisites

The app-level UX (default `docs/ux/ux-design.md`; caller may redirect the
`docs/ux/` root) defines IA, global patterns, and shared interactions. If it is
absent, this is likely greenfield — ask the caller (an app-level UX capability,
e.g. `ux-design`, fits better) rather than halting.

**Methodology lives in the `ux-design` skill.** This skill is lean by design and
has no reference files of its own. For the depth behind each quality bar —
JTBD framing, the 7-state state-machine table, undo/feedback patterns,
error/empty-state copy formulas, and contrast/touch-target/safe-area specs —
consult `skills/ux-design/references/{design-process, interaction-patterns,
ux-writing, ergonomics, cognitive-principles}.md` if available (loaded on
demand, not duplicated here); otherwise apply the quality bar below directly.

## What This Skill Does

Produces one `docs/ux/screens/{screen}.md` covering:

- Screen purpose (JTBD)
- Layout and content hierarchy (1 primary action)
- All 7 states: empty, loading, loaded, error, partial, refreshing, offline
- Interactions specific to this screen
- UX copy (labels, errors, empty states, tooltips)
- Accessibility notes

It updates `docs/ux/ux-design.md` ONLY if IA changes (e.g., new nav entry, new
route); otherwise it leaves that file alone. See **Workflow** below for the
procedure.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not rewrite app-level UX
- Does not redesign navigation unless the new screen demands it
- Does not produce visual designs, tokens, or component code
- Does not produce tasks

**Next:** routing hints, not steps this skill performs — once the screen spec is
approved, a task-breakdown capability (e.g. `task-add`) can split it into
implementation tasks, and a design-token capability (e.g. `design-system`)
covers visual tokens and components, if available.

## Workflow

1. **Read app UX** — `docs/ux/ux-design.md` for IA, conventions, accessibility
2. **Read feature spec** (if applicable) — `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md`. If
   no feature spec exists, source requirements from the discovery questions in
   step 3 and the relevant `docs/ux/ux-design.md` flows.
3. **Discover the screen** — minimum questions:
   - What is the user's ONE goal on this screen?
   - Where do they arrive from? Where do they go next?
   - Any platform-specific constraints (mobile vs desktop)?
4. **Design with all 7 states** — empty, loading, loaded, error, partial,
   refreshing, offline
5. **Write UX copy** — specific verbs for buttons, "what + how to fix" for
   errors, explanation + CTA for empty states
6. **Patch `ux-design.md` if needed** — only when global IA or conventions
   change

## Quality Bar

`ux-design`'s Quick Checklist (its Screen Design, Interaction, Copy, and
Platform sections) is canonical. The list below is a convenience copy of that
subset — if the two ever diverge, defer to `ux-design`.

- [ ] User's ONE goal stated as JTBD
- [ ] Primary action is ONE and visually dominant
- [ ] All 7 states designed (empty, loading, loaded, error, partial, refreshing, offline)
- [ ] Feedback exists for every user action
- [ ] Destructive actions confirmed (stating what will happen); reversible actions offer undo
- [ ] Button labels are specific verbs (not "OK", "Submit", "Yes")
- [ ] Error messages: what happened + how to fix
- [ ] Empty states: explanation + actionable CTA
- [ ] Accessibility: contrast, focus, keyboard, screen reader labels
- [ ] Mobile: primary actions in thumb zone, safe areas respected

## Output

- the screen spec (default `docs/ux/screens/{screen}.md`; caller may redirect) — new or updated file
- the app-level UX file — patched only if IA/conventions change

**Line limit:** the screen spec — 300 lines. If exceeded, split
into child screens (e.g., `settings-profile.md`, `settings-billing.md`).

**Naming:** kebab-case matching the screen name. Modals, drawers, and sheets
that belong to a screen live in that screen's file.
