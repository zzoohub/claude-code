  Provider-neutral LLM application design: prompt engineering, tool use, RAG, agent patterns, evaluation, and production concerns.
  Use when: designing an AI feature (chatbot, copilot, agent, RAG, classification, extraction), deciding whether to use an LLM, choosing an agent vs a fixed workflow, or setting up evals. Also trigger on "AI feature", "LLM app", "agentic pipeline/workflow", "LLM/agent workflow", "retrieval augmented", "prompt engineering", "system prompt", "eval", "LLM-as-judge", "tool use", "function calling", "semantic search", "fine-tune vs prompt", "LLM latency/cost".
  Do not use for: system-level AI architecture — LLM gateways, deployment topology, vector-store/orchestration, protocols (MCP/A2A/AG-UI), durable execution, model lifecycle (use software-architecture); provider-specific SDK mechanics (use claude-api for Anthropic, vercel:ai-sdk for multi-provider); observability setup (use posthog:instrument-llm-analytics or sentry:sentry-setup-ai-monitoring); or ML/training.

# LLM Application Design

A design and operational-planning skill, not a coding skill. It helps you decide **what to build, how to structure it, how to know if it works, and how to operate it** — everything before and around the SDK, but not the SDK calls themselves.

## The first question: do you need an LLM?

LLMs are the right tool when the problem has:

- **Open-ended language** — input or output is free-form prose, where hand-coded rules would miss cases.
- **Fuzzy matching or synthesis** — combining or summarizing information that isn't cleanly structured.
- **Novel inputs** — the full input space can't be enumerated, so pattern recognition beats exhaustive rules.

They are the wrong tool when:

- A regex, SQL query, or deterministic function would produce the same answer faster and cheaper.
- Correctness is safety-critical and the model's confidence can't be verified (payments, medical dosing, legal filings without review).
- The output is a simple classification with sufficient training data — a small classifier is usually faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

If you can solve 80% of the task deterministically and only use the LLM for the residual 20%, that's almost always the right architecture. Pre-filter with code, let the model handle the ambiguous cases, post-validate the output.

## The four layers of any LLM app

Every LLM feature decomposes into the same four layers. Design them explicitly — skipping any of them is how systems ship and then degrade silently.

1. **Context layer** — what the model sees: system prompt, user input, retrieved documents, tool results, conversation history. The job here is relevance and cost: get the right tokens in, keep irrelevant tokens out.
2. **Reasoning layer** — how the model thinks: single-shot vs multi-step, chain-of-thought, tool-calling loops, agent planning. The job is matching the task's shape to the model's strengths.
3. **Output layer** — what comes back: free text, structured JSON, tool calls, streaming. The job is making the output usable by downstream code without a second guessing step.
4. **Evaluation layer** — how you know it works: golden examples, LLM-as-judge, A/B tests, production monitoring. The job is catching regressions before users do.

These layers map onto the references: the **Context** and **Output** layers are designed in `references/prompting.md` (fed by `references/rag.md` and `references/tool-use.md` when retrieval or tools supply the context); the **Reasoning** layer is the shape table below plus `references/agents.md`; the **Evaluation** layer is `references/evaluation.md`; and `references/production.md` wraps all four with the operational concerns that decide whether the design survives real traffic.

Most "my LLM app is flaky" problems trace back to a missing or vague layer. If you can't answer "what's in the context, how does it reason, what's the output contract, and how do I measure quality?" in one sentence each, the design isn't ready to implement.

## Picking the shape

Pick the simplest shape that solves the task. Upgrading to a more complex shape is cheap; downgrading from one is a rewrite.

| Task shape | Right architecture | When to upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| Classify, extract, rewrite, summarize | Single prompt, structured output | Never — if this works, stop |
| Answer from a knowledge base | RAG: retrieve → augment → generate | Multi-hop questions need agent retrieval |
| Call external systems (search, DB, API) | Tool use / function calling | Multi-tool planning needs an agent loop |
| Several LLM steps in a *known, fixed* order | Workflow / pipeline: chain, route, parallelize, evaluator-optimize | When steps can't be predetermined → agent |
| Multi-step reasoning where the *model* picks the steps | Agent: plan → act → observe → repeat | Most tasks don't actually need this |
| Multiple specialized roles collaborating | Multi-agent / orchestrator-worker | Only when one agent demonstrably can't do it |

Read `references/prompting.md` before designing any shape — prompt structure underlies all of them. Then jump to the shape-specific reference:

- `references/tool-use.md` — tool/function-calling design
- `references/rag.md` — retrieval architecture, chunking, hybrid search, re-ranking
- `references/agents.md` — the workflow-vs-agent decision, agent loops, planning, safety rails
- `references/evaluation.md` — eval strategies for all shapes
- `references/production.md` — latency, cost, caching, rate limits, observability

**Workflow vs agent — the line that matters most.** A *workflow* (a.k.a. agentic pipeline) runs LLM calls through steps *you* fixed in advance: prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, evaluator-optimizer loops. An *agent* lets the *model* choose the next step at runtime. If you can draw the flowchart before running, build the workflow — it's cheaper, faster, and far easier to debug. Reach for an agent only when the steps genuinely can't be predetermined. See `references/agents.md` for both pattern sets and the decision rule.

**Prompt vs RAG vs fine-tune.** Reach for prompting first; add RAG when the model lacks the facts (table above); fine-tune only when prompting and RAG both fall short on a stable, high-volume task — it trades flexibility and iteration speed for lower per-call cost and tighter style control. For the full cost/maintenance decision matrix, see `software-architecture/references/ai-architecture.md` §8.

**Not every "AI" task needs generation.** Semantic search, clustering, dedup, and some classification are embedding problems, not generation problems — an embedding model + vector index (or a small classifier) is often cheaper, faster, and more reliable than an LLM call. Use the embedding/hybrid-search primitives in `references/rag.md` for the retrieval mechanics; reserve a generation call for when you actually need synthesized language out.

**System-level AI architecture lives elsewhere.** LLM gateways, streaming and deployment topology, vector-store and infrastructure choice, multi-agent orchestration infrastructure, protocols (MCP/A2A/AG-UI), durable execution, and model lifecycle are owned by the `software-architecture` skill (`software-architecture/references/ai-architecture.md`, `software-architecture/references/ai-agents.md`). This skill is the design-discipline layer that runs alongside and after it.

## The design flow

Follow this sequence when designing a new LLM feature. Skipping steps is a false economy — each one takes minutes and saves hours of rework.

**1. Name the task in one sentence.**
"Given X, produce Y, so that Z." If you can't, the task isn't defined well enough to prompt. Example: "Given a customer support ticket, produce a category label and confidence, so that we route high-confidence tickets automatically."

**2. Write 5–10 input/output examples by hand.**
This is your first eval set. If you can't write them, the task is underspecified. If writing them is tedious but possible, congratulations — the LLM is probably the right tool. If writing them feels ambiguous (you'd label things differently on different days), that ambiguity will show up in the model's output too — spec the edge cases first.

**3. Decide the output contract.**
Structured (JSON schema, regex-parseable) or free-form? Structured outputs cost more tokens but cut the downstream validation burden. For anything a program will consume, use structured. For anything a human will read, free-form is fine.

**4. Pick the shape (table above).** Start with the simplest. Don't add an agent because it feels modern — add one when a simpler shape demonstrably fails your eval set.

**5. Write the system prompt.** Role, task, constraints, output format, examples. See `references/prompting.md`.

**6. Run your hand-written examples.** If it passes, expand the eval set. If it fails, read `references/evaluation.md` for how to diagnose.

**7. Plan production concerns.** Before shipping: caching strategy, rate limiting, cost estimation, latency budget, error handling, observability. See `references/production.md`.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

**Prompt stuffing.** Cramming every edge case into the system prompt as a bullet list. LLMs weight long prompts unevenly — the 47th "always do X" gets ignored. Use structure (sections, examples, clear roles) instead of volume.

**No evals.** Iterating on prompts by vibes. Without a fixed eval set, every "fix" can silently break a previous case. You cannot ship an LLM feature responsibly without one — even 10 hand-written examples beat zero.

**Over-agentifying.** Wrapping a single-prompt task in an agent loop because agents are trendy. Agents are multiplicatively more expensive, slower, and harder to debug. Use them only when the task genuinely requires tool-use planning the model has to figure out at runtime.

**Trusting structured output without validation.** Even with JSON mode or schema-constrained decoding, models occasionally drift. Validate every structured output and define recovery (retry, fallback, escalate) before shipping.

**Logging nothing.** LLM apps generate latent failure modes: hallucinations, drift after a model update, quality regression from a prompt tweak. Without traces, you find out from users. Wire observability from day one — it costs almost nothing and saves everything.

**Mixing design and implementation.** Deciding "we'll figure out the prompt while we code" leads to prompts shaped like the first thing that compiled. Design the prompt, the output contract, and the eval set *before* opening the SDK.

This skill's job ends where the implementation SDK begins.

## Output Location

Save the LLM feature design to `docs/arch/ai-features/{feature}.md` (default). Each file is one feature; reference the originating PRD feature in `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md` if applicable.

Structure (≤200 lines):
1. **Task** — one-sentence X → Y → Z
2. **Shape** — single-prompt / RAG / tool use / agent / multi-agent (from the table in this skill)
3. **Context** — system prompt outline, retrieval sources, tool list
4. **Output contract** — structured (JSON schema) or free-form; validation strategy
5. **Eval set** — link to golden examples, metric, judging strategy, and baseline pass rate (record whether the hand-written examples currently pass — closes design-flow step 6)
6. **Production concerns** — latency budget, cost ceiling, caching, rate limits, observability
7. **Open questions / risks**
