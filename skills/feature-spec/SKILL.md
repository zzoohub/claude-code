description: |
  Write a single feature spec for an existing product. Creates one
  `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md` with requirements, user journeys, edge cases,
  and decisions for the feature. Appends the feature to the existing PRD's
  Feature Overview table and Dev Order WITHOUT rewriting the PRD vision.
  Use when: adding a feature to a product that already has `docs/prd/prd.md`.
  Trigger phrases: "spec out a feature", "write requirements for [feature]",
  "add a feature to the PRD", "feature spec for X".
  Do NOT use for: a new product from scratch (use prd-craft — it creates the
  full PRD plus all feature specs at once). Do NOT use for user stories or
  sprint tickets, breaking the feature into tasks (use task-add), architecture
  decisions (use arch-decision), or screen design (use screen-design).

# Feature Spec — Single Feature on Existing Product

Use when the product already exists and you need to add a feature without
rewriting the vision PRD.

## Prerequisites

The PRD must already exist (default `docs/prd/prd.md`; caller may redirect).

**If no PRD exists yet**, ask the caller rather than halting — a single feature
spec with no product vision to anchor it has nothing to tie back to. Surface
that the full-PRD path (which creates the vision PRD plus feature specs) or an
earlier product-brief path fits better if the idea is still unvalidated, and
route there if such a capability is available.

## What This Skill Does

1. Reads the existing PRD (default `docs/prd/prd.md`; caller may redirect) to
   understand the product, target users, success metrics, and existing feature
   list — these constrain the new feature's shape and naming.
2. Reads existing feature specs (default `docs/prd/features/*.md`) to avoid
   naming conflicts and to reference related features.
3. Asks the minimum questions needed to write the spec (problem, journey,
   acceptance — ~3 for a typical feature; ask more only if the feature is
   genuinely complex — multiple user types, compliance, cross-feature
   dependencies). Skip what's already clear from the PRD or the user's request.
4. Writes one new feature spec at `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md` (or the
   caller's chosen features directory) following the template below.
5. Patches the PRD in place. Locate sections by **role**, not by fixed
   number (a hand-written or differently-organized PRD may number or title them
   differently; §5/§6 are just the default full-PRD layout):
   - Find the **Feature Overview** table and add a row for the feature. If a row
     for it already exists, **update it in place** — don't append a duplicate.
   - Find the **Dev Order** / roadmap section and insert (or update) the feature
     at the right position.
   - If the PRD has no such table/section, ask the user where to record it rather
     than inventing one.
   - Touch the problem/users/metrics sections only if the feature changes the
     problem framing or success metric — usually it doesn't.
   - Bump the PRD's **Last Updated** field — the patch is an update; an old date
     on a just-patched PRD reads as stale (PRD anti-pattern #9).

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not rewrite the PRD vision
- Does not touch Problem, Target Users, Success Metrics, Proposed Solution
  unless the new feature genuinely changes them (rare)
- Does not create architecture decisions
- Does not create UX screens
- Does not create tasks

## Feature Spec Template

Same shape used across feature specs:

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Overview
Connects this feature to the product vision (1-2 sentences tied to the PRD's
problem statement).

## Requirements
Testable, specific. Give each a stable ID (`REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, ...) so tasks
and tests can reference it. Format: `REQ-` plus a zero-padded 3-digit sequence.

## User Journeys
Step-by-step flows for each user type.

## Edge Cases & Error States
The failure modes that matter for THIS feature. Cover the relevant categories —
invalid/empty input, unauthorized actor, concurrent or duplicate action,
limit/quota exceeded, upstream/dependency failure, partial success — not a fixed
checklist.

## Technical Decisions
Feature-level choices — dedupe window, retention period, validation strictness,
default formats. Stack/infra picks are architectural: route those to an
architecture-decision capability instead of recording them here.

## Out of Scope
What this feature does NOT do, with rationale.

## Open Questions
Unknowns still being resolved. Flag them — don't invent answers. Remove as they resolve.
```

## Workflow

1. **Read context** — the PRD (default `docs/prd/prd.md`) + relevant existing feature specs (default `docs/prd/features/*.md`)
2. **Discover the feature** — ask the questions from "What This Skill Does" step 3:
   - What user problem does this solve? (must tie back to the PRD problem)
   - What's the core user journey, end-to-end?
   - What does "done" look like — what acceptance defines success?
3. **Draft the spec** — Use the feature-spec template; keep it within the 200-line limit
4. **Patch the PRD** — Add (or update, if already present) the feature's Feature
   Overview row and Dev Order entry, locating those sections by role. Check
   the PRD against its 400-line limit first; consolidate if it would exceed.
5. **Quality check** — see Quality Bar below

## Quality Bar

- [ ] Feature ties back to the problem stated in the PRD's problem/opportunity section
- [ ] Requirements are numbered with `REQ-NNN` IDs, testable, specific
- [ ] At least one full user journey is mapped
- [ ] Edge cases cover the failure modes relevant to this feature (invalid/empty input, unauthorized, concurrent/duplicate, limit exceeded, upstream failure, partial success)
- [ ] Open questions are flagged — no invented answers
- [ ] Passes the critical PRD anti-patterns: no solution-as-problem Overview, no library/framework names in Requirements, every requirement has evidence (see the PRD anti-patterns reference, e.g. `prd-craft/references/anti-patterns.md`, if available)
- [ ] Feature appears exactly once in the PRD's Feature Overview and once in Dev Order (update in place on re-run, don't duplicate), and the PRD's Last Updated is bumped
- [ ] Filename matches the kebab-case feature name from the PRD

## Output

- `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md` (or the caller's chosen features directory) — new file
- the PRD (default `docs/prd/prd.md`) — patched (Feature Overview table + Dev Order, Last Updated bumped)

**Line limit:** the feature spec — 200 lines. Consolidate if over.

**Next:** once the spec is approved, the feature flows into the same downstream
stages as any PRD feature — an architecture-decision pass (if it needs an
architecture call), screen design (if it has UI), then task breakdown — using
those capabilities if available. Routing hints, not steps this skill performs.
