  Record a single Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for an existing system.
  Creates one ADR file at `docs/arch/adr/ADR-NNN-{slug}.md`.
  Patches `docs/arch/system.md` only when the decision changes the architecture
  surface (new component, swapped pattern).
  Use when: you need to record one architectural choice on an existing system —
  swapping a pattern, adding a component, choosing a library, migrating a piece
  of infrastructure. Trigger phrases: "record an ADR", "we decided to X",
  "make an architecture decision about X", "let's switch from X to Y".
  Do NOT use for: a new system from scratch (use software-architecture — it
  produces the full design doc plus initial ADRs). Do NOT use for: schema
  decisions (use database-design). Do NOT use for: writing feature requirements
  (use feature-spec). Do NOT use for: pure code refactors that don't shift
  architecture (just open a task).

# Arch Decision — Single ADR

Record one decision, tied to the existing system's ASRs, without rewriting
`context.md` or `system.md`.

## Prerequisites

The architecture docs root defaults to `docs/arch/` (caller may redirect).
`docs/arch/context.md` and `docs/arch/system.md` are the inputs; if either is
absent, ask the caller rather than halting — you can still record an ADR
against a missing context, but flag the gap.

## What This Skill Does

1. Reads existing `docs/arch/context.md` (problem, ASRs, domain) and
   `docs/arch/system.md` (current patterns, components) for context.
2. Frames the decision — one decision per ADR. If multiple unrelated decisions
   surface, split into separate ADRs (one per decision).
3. Captures 2-4 realistic options including "do nothing / keep current."
4. States the choice with reasoning tied to an ASR or constraint from
   `context.md` §3.
5. Records consequences — enables, costs, risks, affected components.
6. Writes the ADR as a new file at `docs/arch/adr/ADR-NNN-{slug}.md` (one
   decision per file).
7. Patches the affected section of `system.md` ONLY if the decision changes
   the surface (new component, new pattern). Otherwise leaves `system.md` alone.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not rewrite `context.md` (the problem and ASRs don't change)
- Does not rewrite `system.md` from scratch
- Does not produce diagrams unless the decision adds a new container
- Does not produce database schema changes

## ADR Template (MADR/Nygard-style — extends the `software-architecture` ADR format)

```markdown
## ADR-{NNN}: {Title} — YYYY-MM-DD

- **Status:** Accepted | Proposed | Superseded by ADR-{NNN}
- **Door:** One-way (irreversible) | Two-way (reversible)
- **Context:** Issue motivating this decision. Cite ASRs from `docs/arch/context.md` §3, and the feature spec at `docs/prd/features/{feature}.md` if feature-driven.
- **Options:**
  1. **{Option A}** — pros / cons
  2. **{Option B}** — pros / cons
  3. **Keep current / do nothing** — pros / cons (always include)
- **Decision:** Chose {X}.
- **Why:** Reason tied to ASR or constraint.
- **Rejected:** Why other options were rejected.
- **Tradeoff:** Positive and negative consequences. Affected components from `system.md` §2 (or "none").
- **Revisit when:** Trigger conditions that should prompt reconsideration (scale threshold, library deprecation, new ASR, etc.).
```

This aligns with the standard `software-architecture` ADR template (in that skill's
templates if installed; otherwise the format above is self-sufficient): it shares
`Status` / Door / Context / Decision / Why / Rejected / Tradeoff / Revisit-when, **adds**
an explicit `Options` list, and **omits** `Stage` (a standalone decision has no
design-flow stage). `Rejected` states why each *other* option lost the comparison —
not a restatement of its cons. ADRs authored here sit in the same `docs/arch/adr/`
directory as ones authored by `software-architecture`; that mixed field shape across
files is expected.

**One-way doors** (analyze carefully): database choice, primary language, auth architecture, core domain model.
**Two-way doors** (decide fast): library choice, caching strategy, log format, CI tool.

## Workflow

1. **Read context** — `docs/arch/context.md` and `docs/arch/system.md`. If
   either is missing, flag the gap to the user; you can still proceed.
2. **Get the next ADR number** — Find the highest existing `ADR-NNN` in
   `docs/arch/adr/` and add 1. NNN is zero-padded to 3 digits (`ADR-001`). If
   `docs/arch/adr/` doesn't exist yet, start at `ADR-001`.
3. **Frame one decision** — If multiple decisions surface, ask the user which
   to record first; defer the others to follow-up ADRs.
4. **Draft 2-4 options** — Include "keep current" as one option.
5. **Tie the choice to an ASR** — If you can't, the decision probably isn't
   ready, or the ASR list is incomplete (raise that).
6. **Write the ADR** — Create a new `docs/arch/adr/ADR-NNN-{slug}.md` file.
7. **Patch system.md if needed** — Only when surface changes (new component,
   new pattern, etc.).

## Quality Bar

- [ ] One decision, clearly named
- [ ] 2-4 realistic options considered, including "keep current"
- [ ] Decision tied to a specific ASR or constraint from `context.md`
- [ ] Consequences spelled out (enables / costs / risks / affected components)
- [ ] ADR number is unique and monotonically increasing
- [ ] If the decision changes architecture surface, `system.md` is patched in
      the affected section
- [ ] Status is valid (`Accepted`, or `Proposed` if pending review; if this ADR
      replaces an existing one, mark that older ADR `Superseded by ADR-{NNN}`)

## Output

- the new ADR file (default `docs/arch/adr/ADR-NNN-{slug}.md`) — created
- `docs/arch/system.md` — patched if architecture surface changed

**Superseding:** ADRs are one file per decision — there is no aggregate line cap.
When a new decision replaces an older one, set the older ADR's `Status` to
`Superseded by ADR-{NNN}` in its file rather than deleting it.
