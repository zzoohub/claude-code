## Task Routing

Match the task to the right workflow:

| Task | Approach | Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Choose/apply a persuasion framework** (diagnose audience awareness) | Match awareness state → pick PAS / AIDA / BAB / 4Ps / SSS → apply structure | `references/persuasion-frameworks.md` |
| **Write new page** (landing, homepage, pricing, feature) | Gather context → Pick persuasion framework → Structure the page → Write sections → Apply 8 Principles | `references/copy-frameworks.md` |
| **Write headlines & CTAs** | Generate 3+ variations → Apply Principles 1-4 → Pick strongest | `references/copy-frameworks.md` (CTA section) |
| **Edit/improve existing copy** | Run Seven Sweeps in order → Fix issues per sweep → Re-check | `references/editing-sweeps.md` |
| **Write UX microcopy** (tooltips, errors, empty states, buttons) | Clarity over cleverness → Anticipate questions → Progressive disclosure | UX Standards below |
| **Develop brand voice** | Define traits → Set tone spectrum → Create do's/don'ts | Brand Voice section below |
| **Write long-form content** (blog, narrative, long-form email body — flow only) | Build narrative arc → Use transitions → Maintain scannable flow | `references/transitions.md` |
| **Simplify/clarify copy** | Cut jargon → Use plain alternatives → Read aloud test | `references/plain-english.md` |

## 8 Principles for High-Converting Copy

Apply these as a mandatory checklist for all marketing copy, banners, CTAs, and user-facing promotional text.

### Principle 1: One Message Only

Do not list every benefit in a single line. Give the user exactly one reason to click right now. Save the rest for after the click.

- Bad: "Check your spending type, share with your partner, and win up to $5"
- Good: "Take the 10-question test and see your result"

Why: When benefits pile up, the sentence becomes complex and the message blurs. A single focused action reads as one concept, even if it contains multiple words.

### Principle 2: Certainty Beats Maximum Reward

Users respond more to small guaranteed rewards than large uncertain ones. "You'll definitely get X" consistently outperforms "Up to Y".

- Bad: "Get up to $100 in random points"
- Good: "Get $1 to $100 — guaranteed"

Why: "Up to" feels like a gamble. Certainty removes hesitation. Even a tiny confirmed reward triggers action.

### Principle 3: Novelty Is Enough

Simply telling users something is new can outperform detailed benefit explanations. In one fintech's A/B tests (Toss), leading with "new" beat benefit-focused copy by 6x in click-through rate — treat it as a strong signal, not a universal constant.

- Bad: "Save up to 10% at convenience stores with this membership"
- Good: "There's a new convenience store benefit for you"

Why: Novelty triggers curiosity. The explanation can happen after the click.

### Principle 4: Specify the Concrete Action

Tell users exactly what they need to do and how much effort it takes. Remove the "how much will this take?" hesitation.

- Bad: "Fill in the blanks and get points"
- Good: "Fill 8 boxes and get points"
- Also good: "Just tap the button", "Takes 10 seconds"

Why: Specific numbers, time estimates, and familiar everyday actions eliminate the moment of pause before clicking.

### Principle 5: Power of Aggregation

Words like "list," "browse all," and "see everything in one place" consistently perform well. They signal completeness and reduce the user's fear of missing out.

- Example: "See the full list of loans you qualify for" sustained high CTR over time.

Why: Aggregation language promises comprehensive, organized information — users trust they won't need to look elsewhere.

### Principle 6: Write So It Reads as One Message

Even if copy contains multiple elements, it must feel like a single cohesive thought — not fragmented bullet points crammed into a sentence.

- Bad: "Test your spending, share with partner, check compatibility, win prizes"
- Good: "Take the spending compatibility test with your partner"

Why: The human brain processes one concept at a time. If the reader has to parse multiple ideas, they skip it.

### Principle 7: Write for the Skimmer (Eyeball Monkey Bars)

Most internet readers scan rather than read top-to-bottom. Make copy effortless to navigate — short paragraphs, bullet brigades, snappy sentences, and disproportionate time spent on the hook. See `references/transitions.md` → Scannable Flow for the full guidance, the NN/g source, and rules of thumb.

Why: Long copy still works — but only when every paragraph earns its place. People visit your site to find info, not to read prose. Make the finding effortless.

### Principle 8: Specificity Over Kitchen-Sink Promises

Solve one acute, pressing problem — not a vague, catch-all solution. Tailored solutions beat generic bundles every time.

- Bad: "The all-in-one solution for your business"
- Good: "Fix your checkout abandonment rate in 3 steps"

Why: Audiences are more savvy than ever. Algorithms serve hyper-personalized ads, so vague messaging feels outdated. Speak directly to one pain point and deliver a focused solution. Personalized beats generic.

## Voice & Authenticity

For detailed voice guidelines (plain English alternatives, jargon elimination, conversational tone, the "EveryPerson" factor), consult `references/plain-english.md`.

Core rule: Write like a real person talking to another real person. Proof everything. Have an opinion.

## Process

### 1. Context Gathering

Ask briefly for missing context, but don't block on it. If the user provides minimal info, state your assumptions and proceed.

**Ask for:**
- Target audience and desired action
- Constraints (character limits, tone, platform)
- Brand voice guidelines if they exist

**Defaults when not provided:**
- Audience: infer from the product/context described
- Tone: professional but friendly
- Goal: conversion (clicks, signups) unless clearly informational
- Constraints: standard web copy lengths

State assumptions at the top of your output so the user can correct them.

### 2. Brand Voice Development

When creating or refining brand voice guidelines, deliver:
- **Personality traits**: 3-5 adjectives that define the brand character (e.g., friendly, confident, straightforward)
- **Tone spectrum**: How voice shifts across contexts (celebration vs error vs onboarding)
- **Do's and Don'ts**: Specific examples of language that fits vs doesn't
- **Vocabulary preferences**: Preferred terms and terms to avoid
- **Formatting standards**: Punctuation, capitalization, emoji usage rules

Output a reusable reference document that any team member can apply consistently. Its default home is the marketing strategy doc's Brand Voice section (`biz/marketing/strategy.md`, owned by the caller's marketing-strategy context; caller may redirect) — if no file-write capability is present, return it inline.

### 3. Writing Approach

- Lead with the user's action, not your product's features
- Use active voice and present tense
- Keep sentences short and scannable
- Apply all 8 Principles as a checklist on every draft
- Write 2-3 variations minimum for any key copy
- Use AI as a brainstorming partner for ideas and draft refinement, but always ensure the final voice feels unmistakably human

### 4. UX Microcopy Standards

- Clarity over cleverness — users should never be confused
- Anticipate user questions and address them proactively
- Use progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the experience
- Write error messages that help, not frustrate
- Frame negatives as positives ("You can do X" instead of "You can't do Y")

### 5. Output Format

For every copy deliverable, provide:

1. **The copy itself** — organized by section (headline, subheadline, body, CTA)
2. **Annotations** — brief notes on key choices and which principles apply
3. **2-3 alternatives** — for headlines and CTAs, always provide variations with rationale
4. **Assumptions stated** — if context was missing, list what you assumed

For page-level copy, follow the section structure in `references/copy-frameworks.md`.

### 6. Quality Checklist

Before delivering any copy, verify:
- [ ] Does it pass all 8 Principles? (for conversion/promotional copy — skip for neutral UX microcopy like errors and tooltips)
- [ ] Is there exactly one clear message?
- [ ] Is the desired action obvious?
- [ ] Does it align with brand voice?
- [ ] Is it appropriate for the target audience?
- [ ] Is it concise without losing meaning?
- [ ] Would this sound natural if spoken aloud?
- [ ] Is it accessible and inclusive (no jargon, slang, or in-group terms)?
- [ ] Is it scannable? Can a skimmer get the point in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is every claim either backed by real proof/social validation, or softened to what's truthfully supportable? (Never fabricate proof.)
