# Service Architecture Patterns

Service architecture defines **how each service is internally structured** — code organization, domain isolation, dependency direction, and module boundaries.

For how services communicate *with each other* (event-driven, CQRS, saga, etc.), see `system-architecture.md`.

**Default: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).** Choose an alternative only with clear rationale documented as an ADR.

## Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) — Default

Organize code around a pure domain core. External concerns (HTTP, database, queues) connect through **ports** (interfaces) and **adapters** (implementations). Dependencies always point inward — domain code never imports framework or infrastructure code.

```
         +-------------------------------------+
         |            Application               |
         |  +-------------------------------+   |
Driving  |  |                               |   |  Driven
Adapters |  |     Domain / Business Logic    |   |  Adapters
(HTTP,   |--|                               |-->|  (DB, Queue,
CLI,     |  |     (Pure, no dependencies)    |   |   External
Events)  |  |                               |   |   APIs)
         |  +-------------------------------+   |
         |         Ports (Interfaces)           |
         +-------------------------------------+
```

**Strengths**: Domain logic testable in isolation (no mocks for infrastructure), adapters are swappable (swap Postgres for SQLite in tests, swap email provider without touching domain), clear boundaries prevent accidental coupling, scales with complexity.

**Trade-offs**: More files and indirection than simpler approaches, port/adapter wiring can feel ceremonial for trivial services, requires discipline to keep domain truly pure.

**Choose when**: This is the default. Business logic exists beyond simple CRUD. You anticipate adapter changes (provider migrations, testing strategies). Team size > 1 where clear boundaries prevent stepping on each other's code.

**Structure** (framework-neutral):

```
src/
+-- domain/           # Pure business logic — no imports from outside
|   +-- models/       # Entities, value objects, domain errors
|   +-- services/     # Domain services (orchestrate domain logic)
|   +-- ports/        # Interfaces (driven ports)
+-- application/      # Use cases — orchestrate domain + ports
|   +-- use-cases/
+-- adapters/         # Infrastructure implementations
|   +-- http/         # Driving adapter: HTTP handlers
|   +-- persistence/  # Driven adapter: repositories
|   +-- external/     # Driven adapter: third-party API clients
+-- config/           # Wiring: dependency injection, app bootstrap
```

**Who uses it**: Stripe (per-service hexagonal with clean domain boundaries), Netflix DGS framework (GraphQL services with hexagonal internals), most mature backend systems with complex domain logic.

## Clean Architecture

Uncle Bob's concentric circles model. Shares hexagonal's core principle (dependency inversion, domain at center) but introduces explicit **Use Case** and **Interface Adapter** layers.

```
+---------------------------------------------+
|  Frameworks & Drivers                        |
|  +----------------------------------------+  |
|  |  Interface Adapters                     |  |
|  |  +---------------------------------+   |  |
|  |  |  Use Cases                       |   |  |
|  |  |  +--------------------------+   |   |  |
|  |  |  |  Entities (Domain)       |   |   |  |
|  |  |  +--------------------------+   |   |  |
|  |  +---------------------------------+   |  |
|  +----------------------------------------+  |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

**How it differs from Hexagonal**:
- Hexagonal distinguishes *driving* (input) vs *driven* (output) adapters. Clean Architecture doesn't — it has "Interface Adapters" as one layer.
- Clean Architecture explicitly names the **Use Case** layer (application services that orchestrate domain entities). In hexagonal, this is implicit or folded into "application layer."
- **Onion Architecture** is a close relative — same concentric dependency rule, slightly different layer naming.

**Strengths**: Explicit Use Case layer makes application workflows visible. Well-documented (books, talks, large community). Clear dependency rule: source code dependencies point inward only.

**Trade-offs**: The four-layer naming can feel rigid. In practice, the difference from hexagonal is cosmetic — choose based on team familiarity, not technical merit.

**Choose when**: Team already thinks in Clean Architecture terms. Java/Kotlin/C# ecosystem where Clean Architecture conventions dominate. You want explicit Use Case objects as the primary API surface.

**Who uses it**: Toss (Korean fintech — Clean Architecture per module within their modular monolith), many Android/iOS teams (Google's recommended architecture follows Clean principles).

## Vertical Slice Architecture

Organize by **feature**, not by layer. Each feature (or use case) owns its complete stack: handler -> business logic -> data access. No shared service or repository layers — each slice is independent.

```
src/
+-- features/
|   +-- create-order/
|   |   +-- handler          # HTTP endpoint
|   |   +-- command          # Input validation
|   |   +-- logic            # Business rules
|   |   +-- repository       # Data access
|   +-- get-order/
|   |   +-- handler
|   |   +-- query
|   |   +-- repository       # Can use different DB/cache
|   +-- cancel-order/
|       +-- handler
|       +-- command
|       +-- logic
|       +-- repository
+-- shared/                   # Only truly cross-cutting code
    +-- auth/
    +-- middleware/
```

**Strengths**: Each feature is self-contained — easy to understand, modify, and delete without affecting others. No "god service" or "god repository" classes. Natural fit with CQRS. Low coupling between features.

**Trade-offs**: Code duplication between slices (intentional — independence over DRY). Shared concerns still need a cross-cutting solution. Can feel scattered when the domain has deep cross-feature interactions.

**Choose when**: CQRS architecture (each command/query maps to a slice). Features are genuinely independent. You value feature isolation over code reuse. Team works on features independently.

**Who uses it**: Many .NET teams (Jimmy Bogard's MediatR pattern popularized this). Works well in event-driven systems where each event handler is a natural slice.

## Functional Core, Imperative Shell

Separate **pure business logic** (functional core) from **side effects** (imperative shell). The core is a collection of pure functions: given input, return output, no I/O. The shell handles all I/O (HTTP, database, file system) and feeds data into the core.

```
+-------------------------------------+
|         Imperative Shell             |
|  (HTTP handlers, DB queries, I/O)    |
|                                      |
|    input --> +----------------+      |
|              | Functional     |      |
|              |   Core         |      |
|              | (pure logic)   |      |
|    output <--+----------------+      |
|                                      |
|  (write results, send responses)     |
+-------------------------------------+
```

**Strengths**: Core logic is trivially testable (pure functions — no mocks, no setup, just input/output assertions). Side effects are contained and explicit. Reasoning about business logic is easier when it can't secretly talk to a database.

**Trade-offs**: Requires rethinking workflows that naturally interleave I/O and logic. Can lead to "data shuttle" patterns where the shell fetches everything upfront.

**Choose when**: Rust (ownership model naturally separates data from I/O — this pattern is idiomatic). Complex business rules that benefit from pure-function testing. The domain can be modeled as "gather data -> compute -> persist results" without mid-computation I/O.

**Who uses it**: Elm (the language enforces this pattern), many Rust and Haskell projects. Gary Bernhardt's "Boundaries" talk (2012) codified the pattern. Discord's Rust services use this style for hot paths.

## Service Architecture Decision Guide

```
Do you have significant business logic beyond CRUD?
+-- NO  -> Hexagonal (still default — keeps structure clean for when logic grows)
|         or Vertical Slice (if it's many independent endpoints)
+-- YES ->
    Is the team already using Clean Architecture conventions?
    +-- YES -> Clean Architecture (don't force a migration — same principles)
    +-- NO  ->
        Are features genuinely independent (minimal cross-feature logic)?
        +-- YES -> Vertical Slice (especially with CQRS)
        +-- NO  ->
            Is the domain modeled as pure computation?
            +-- YES -> Functional Core, Imperative Shell
            +-- NO  -> Hexagonal (default)
```

**Combining patterns** — these are not mutually exclusive:
- **Hexagonal + DDD**: Hexagonal structure with DDD tactical patterns (Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain Events) for complex domains.
- **Vertical Slice + CQRS**: Each command/query is a slice. Natural fit.
- **Hexagonal + Functional Core**: Domain layer in hexagonal *is* the functional core. Adapters = shell.
- **Vertical Slice + Hexagonal per slice**: Each slice internally follows hexagonal structure when the slice has complex logic.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

### In-Process Domain Events

When side effects grow within a service, direct calls raise coupling. Refactor so the service emits domain events and independent handlers react — adding side effects no longer touches the originating service.

**Trade-off**: Flow spreads across files (harder to trace). Use sparingly — direct calls are fine for 1-2 side effects. Switch to events when adding a side effect requires modifying the originating service.

**Distinct from system-level events**: These are in-process, within a single service. Not Kafka/Queues — just an internal event bus or simple pub/sub pattern. For system-level event-driven architecture, see `system-architecture.md`.

### DDD Tactical Patterns

Domain-Driven Design tactical patterns can be applied **with any service architecture**. Use when the domain has complex business rules, invariants to protect, or rich behavior beyond data manipulation.

| Pattern | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Aggregate** | Cluster of entities treated as a single unit for data changes. Enforces invariants. | Data has complex consistency rules (e.g., Order + OrderItems must be consistent) |
| **Value Object** | Immutable object defined by its attributes, not identity | Money, Email, DateRange — anywhere equality is by value, not by reference |
| **Domain Event** | Record of something significant that happened in the domain | Other parts of the system need to react to domain state changes |
| **Repository** | Abstraction over data access, returns domain objects | Always — this is just the "driven port" in hexagonal terms |
| **Domain Service** | Logic that doesn't belong to a single entity | Cross-entity operations (e.g., transfer money between two accounts) |

**Don't over-apply DDD**: For simple CRUD domains, DDD tactical patterns add unnecessary abstraction. Use when the domain warrants it — complex rules, many invariants, rich behavior. "Is this entity just a data bag? Then skip Aggregate."

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Anemic Domain Model**: Domain entities are just data holders with getters/setters. All logic lives in services. You get the ceremony of domain modeling without the benefit — the domain can't protect its own invariants.

**Big Ball of Mud**: No discernible architecture. Everything imports everything. Starts as "move fast," ends as "can't change anything without breaking something else."

**Leaky Abstractions**: Domain layer imports infrastructure types (e.g., domain service takes a DB pool directly instead of a repository port). Defeats the purpose of architecture boundaries.

**Premature Abstraction**: Creating ports/adapters for things that will never change. YAGNI applies to architecture too.

**Shared Kernel Bloat**: The `shared/` or `common/` package grows to contain half the codebase. If everything is shared, nothing is isolated.
