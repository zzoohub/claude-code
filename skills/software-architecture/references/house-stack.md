# Pre-vetted House Stack

This is not a neutral catalog of technology options — it is a **curated house stack** built around Cloudflare Workers/Containers, GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, BigQuery), Supabase for Postgres, and a short list of proven external services. Choices reflect operational familiarity, regional constraints (Korea), and cost discipline.

This file is **opinionated and deliberately non-portable** — it encodes one shop's procurement, not universal guidance. On another runtime or org, treat it as a worked example, not a mandate.

**When to use these**: Default to the options below. They require no additional justification.

**When to deviate**: A choice outside this list requires an ADR in `docs/arch/adr/` that explicitly documents:
1. Why the house option was insufficient (specific capability gap, not "I prefer X")
2. What the deviation costs — operational burden, new runtime, extra billing surface
3. Revisit condition — when should we reconsider going back to the house option?

Deviation is fine when justified. Unjustified deviation is tech debt.

**Maturity tags**: items tagged **(beta)** / **(RC)** are pre-GA — fine as defaults, but a production-critical dependency on one should be a conscious choice, not an accident. Prefer the inline GA fallback when the guarantee matters.

**Cloud split — read first**: Cloudflare and GCP are *not* interchangeable co-equals; the relationship is **hub-and-spoke**. Default to **Cloudflare** for the edge / serverless / agent fabric and the global front door; reach for **GCP** for regional heavy compute (Cloud Run GPUs, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Pub/Sub) and the **Korea data-residency anchor** (`asia-northeast3`). Workers VPC + Hyperdrive stitch the two into one private network (Workers in front, Cloud SQL behind). When a row lists both, the CF option is the primary and the GCP option is the heavy-or-Korea trigger.

## Language & Runtime

| Role | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript, Rust, Python |
| JS runtime / toolchain | **Bun** (runtime, package manager, bundler, test) |
| Python toolchain | **uv** (env, dependency resolution, lock) |

Go is **deliberately excluded** — Rust covers the performance/CLI niche, TypeScript covers services. Add Go only via an ADR if a team lacks the Rust depth for stateless Container/Cloud Run services.
