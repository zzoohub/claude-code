  Produce a full Software Architecture Design Document from a PRD: context, system
  design, decision records, and D2 diagrams.
  Use when: "design doc", "software architecture", "system design", "architect
  this", "tech spec", "how should I build this", "what's the right architecture
  for", "help me plan the backend", "ASR", "utility tree", "domain model", "ATAM",
  "event storming", or a PRD needs technical architecture for a NEW project. Also
  trigger on AI/LLM features (RAG, agents, chat, copilot, semantic search). Also
  use to "review", "audit", or "diagnose" an EXISTING architecture, read-only (see
  Review / Diagnose Mode).
  Do NOT use for: a single architectural decision on an existing system (use
  arch-decision); table schemas, columns, indexes, or migrations (use
  database-design); folder structure, code conventions, or linting (CLAUDE.md);
  concrete UI component trees or page layouts (use ux-design + design-system);
  implementation-level LLM details like prompts, tool schemas, or evals (use
  llm-app-design).

# Software Architecture — Full Design Pass

Produces the **full architecture documents** for a new system from a PRD:
context, system design, and decision log. Use this skill at the start of a
new project.

## Premise

Architecture for **system correctness**, not for persuasion.

- **Strengthen**: Logical rigor of decisions, context-restorable structure, fitness functions as automated reviewers
- **Eliminate**: Redundant ceremony — sections, diagrams, and documents that don't inform decisions

**The "6-Month Test"**: If you come back to this project after 6 months away, can you read the docs and understand the system well enough to start making changes within 10 minutes? If yes, it's good enough.

## Philosophy

Great architecture documents are **decision records, not implementation manuals**. Every section must answer *why* a choice was made, not just *what* was chosen. If there are no trade-offs to discuss, the section doesn't belong.

---

## Two Modes

- **Build Mode (default)** — produce or extend the full architecture from a PRD via the Design Flow below. This is everything in this file except the Review / Diagnose Mode section.
- **Review / Diagnose Mode** — a **read-only** audit of an *existing* architecture. Triggered when `docs/arch/context.md` already exists and the user asks to review / audit / diagnose rather than build. It critiques the docs and never regenerates `context.md` or `system.md`. Jump to the [Review / Diagnose Mode](#review--diagnose-mode) section and follow it instead of the Design Flow.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This skill produces architecture-level decisions. It deliberately **excludes** the following — they are separate implementation concerns:

| Excluded Topic | Reason |
|---|---|
| Table schemas, column types, indexes, migrations | Implementation detail — derived from data models in the Design Doc |
| API endpoint lists, request/response shapes | Implementation detail — derived from component interfaces in the Design Doc |
| Folder structure, code conventions, linting rules | Codebase concern — belongs in CLAUDE.md or project config |
| Concrete UI component trees, page layouts | Implementation detail — derived from system context in the Design Doc |

**Note**: API *design philosophy* and observability *strategy* are architectural decisions and ARE covered. What's excluded is the concrete endpoint catalog and boilerplate implementation code.

## Design Flow Overview

| Stage | Name | What It Answers | Output File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Auto-Classification | What type of software? What dimensions matter? | — |
| 1 | Problem Definition | What problem, for whom, why now? | `docs/arch/context.md` §1-2, §5-6 |
| 2 | ASR Extraction & Utility Tree | Which quality attributes drive the architecture? | `docs/arch/context.md` §3 |
| 3 | Domain Model | What are the core concepts and boundaries? | `docs/arch/context.md` §4 |
| 4 | Pattern Selection & ATAM Gate | What patterns satisfy the architecture drivers? | `docs/arch/system.md` §1 |
| 5 | Component Design | What are the concrete components? | `docs/arch/system.md` §2 |
| 6 | Data Architecture | Where does data live, how does it flow? | `docs/arch/system.md` §3 |
| 7 | Deployment | How does code get to production? | `docs/arch/system.md` §4 |
| 8 | Cross-cutting Concerns | What properties hold across all components? | `docs/arch/system.md` §5 |
| 9 | ADR & Risk Review | Are all decisions recorded? What could go wrong? | `docs/arch/decisions.md` |

**Stages 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 co-evolve**: Domain modeling reveals new ASRs, pattern selection changes domain boundaries. One iteration is usually sufficient.

**ADRs are written immediately** when decisions occur — not batched at the end.

See `references/design-flow.md` for detailed methodology for each stage.

---

## Stage 0 — Auto-Classification

**First, read the PRD by path:**
- `docs/prd/prd.md` (vision, dev order, success metrics)
- `docs/prd/features/*.md` (per-feature requirements)
- `docs/prd/product-brief.md` (upstream brief, if present)

If your project keeps PRDs elsewhere, see `AGENTS.md` for the override.

Then analyze the PRD content and classify the software automatically. No user questions — derive everything from the PRD.

### Software Type Classification

| Type | PRD Signals | Architecture Implications |
|---|---|---|
| Web application | users, pages, dashboard, sign up | Client-server, sessions, rendering strategy |
| API service | endpoints, consumers, rate limits | Interface design, versioning, SLA |
| CLI tool | command, flags, terminal, output | Argument parsing, stdio, exit codes |
| Library/SDK | import, package, API surface | Public API, compatibility, dependency policy |
| Data pipeline | ingest, transform, ETL, batch | Throughput, fault tolerance, idempotency |
| Mobile app | iOS, Android, push, offline | Offline-first, sync strategy |
| Desktop app | native, installer, file system | Distribution, auto-update, OS integration |
| Game | real-time, state sync, tick rate | Determinism, netcode, asset pipeline |
| Embedded/IoT | device, firmware, constrained | Resource constraints, OTA, communication protocol |

### Architecture Dimensions (Auto-Extract)

From the PRD, extract:
- **System boundary** — what this system does vs. what's handled externally
- **Expected scale** — users, requests/sec, data volume, or "single-user tool"
- **Latency requirements** — real-time needs, p99 targets
- **Consistency model** — strong vs eventual, where
- **Deployment constraints** — target environment, distribution method
- **Regulatory/compliance** — data residency, audit requirements
- **AI/LLM features** — whether the system includes AI capabilities

If the PRD has critical gaps that block architecture decisions, note them as assumptions in the output.

---

## Output Structure

The design flow produces three output files:

| File | Stages | Purpose | Template |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/arch/context.md` | 0-3 | What and why — problem, ASRs, domain model, constraints, assumptions | `templates/context.md` |
| `docs/arch/system.md` | 4-8 | How — patterns, components, data, deployment, cross-cutting | `templates/system.md` |
| `docs/arch/decisions.md` | All | Decisions and risks — ADRs, risk register, tech debt | `templates/decisions.md` |

If your project keeps architecture docs elsewhere, see `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

Read the template files before writing output. Follow their structure.

### Line limits

Before updating, check the file's line count. If it exceeds the limit,
**consolidate** — merge redundant sections, tighten wording, remove items
already resolved. Trust git history.

Exception for `docs/arch/decisions.md`: ADRs are additive — prepend each new ADR
at the top (newest first), never rewrite existing ones. If the limit is hit,
summarize superseded ADRs to one-line form and mark them
`[superseded by ADR-NNN]` rather than deleting. This skill always writes a
single-file `decisions.md`; the split-file layout (`decisions/ADR-NNN-{slug}.md`)
is opt-in via the `arch-decision` skill.

| File | Limit |
|---|---|
| `docs/arch/context.md` | 400 lines |
| `docs/arch/system.md` | 600 lines |
| `docs/arch/decisions.md` | 400 lines |

---

## Claude Session Guide

For future Claude sessions working on this project:

- **New session** -> always load `docs/arch/context.md` first
- **Implementation work** -> also load `docs/arch/system.md`
- **Decision point** -> prepend a new ADR at the top of `docs/arch/decisions.md` (newest first) immediately

---

## Writing Style

- **Direct and opinionated**. State what you chose and why. Don't hedge excessively.
- **Trade-offs over descriptions**. Every choice should discuss what was gained and what was sacrificed.
- **Concrete over abstract**. "Redis with 15-minute TTL" beats "a caching layer."
- **Diagrams with D2**. Write D2 source directly in the doc — D2 classes give consistent styling (`person` for actors, `cylinder` for databases, `queue` for message brokers, dashed borders for system boundaries). Minimum: System Context (C4 L1) + Container (C4 L2) diagrams. If a D2 rendering tool/skill is installed, use it; otherwise leave the D2 source as-is, or fall back to Mermaid or ASCII.
- **No filler**. If you catch yourself writing "it is important to note that" — delete it.
- **Reference real-world precedent** when helpful: "Netflix uses a similar circuit-breaker pattern for their API gateway" adds credibility and context.

---

## Self-Review

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every [H,H] ASR from the utility tree has a corresponding pattern in the design
- [ ] ATAM gate passed — all [H,H] items verified against chosen patterns
- [ ] Ubiquitous language terms match code terms 1:1
- [ ] Fitness functions defined for key architectural properties (3-5 CI checks)
- [ ] Quality targets have numbers (not "fast" or "reliable" — actual thresholds)
- [ ] Cost estimate exists for two traffic levels (baseline + growth)
- [ ] Every external dependency has a timeout, retry policy, and degradation strategy
- [ ] Data flow is traceable for the main user journey
- [ ] No section exists just because "a design doc should have it" — every section earns its place
- [ ] AI (if applicable): cost ceiling defined, guardrail layers specified, model versions pinned

**The "6-Month Test"**: Do these docs still pass the [6-Month Test](#premise) — readable enough to resume changes within 10 minutes after 6 months away?

---

## Review / Diagnose Mode

Use this mode when the user asks to **review, audit, or diagnose an existing
architecture** — not to build a new one. Trigger: `docs/arch/context.md`
already exists and the intent is to critique, not create.

**Hard rule — never regenerate.** Do NOT run the Design Flow and do NOT rewrite
`context.md` or `system.md` wholesale. A review that silently overwrites the
design it was asked to critique is a failure. The only writes allowed are:

- **Targeted patch** of a specific, named defect, in place — and only after you
  have stated the finding it fixes. One surgical edit per finding, never a
  section-wide rewrite or a "consolidate" pass.
- **Additive append** to the Risk Register or Open Questions in `decisions.md`.
- **A new ADR** via the `arch-decision` skill.

If the user wants a full redesign rather than an audit, stop and run Build Mode
instead — but say so explicitly first.

### Procedure

1. Read all of `docs/arch/*.md` — `context.md`, `system.md`, `decisions.md`,
   and `database.md` if it exists.
2. Audit against the **Self-Review checklist** above, the utility tree's
   `[H,H]` ASRs, and the ATAM gate. Those checklist items *are* the review
   criteria — you are checking whether the existing design still passes them.
3. Rank every finding with the severity rubric below.
4. Disposition each finding:
   - 🔴 / 🟠 fixable now and unambiguous → targeted patch to the affected doc.
   - Accepted risk / won't-fix → append to the Risk Register in `decisions.md`.
   - Needs user input → append to Open Questions in `decisions.md`.
   - Implies a new decision → new ADR via `arch-decision`.
5. **Never** create a separate `review.md` — findings live in the docs they
   concern. Return a severity-ranked summary of what you found and did.

### Severity rubric

- 🔴 **Critical** — correctness / security / data-loss; ATAM gate failure; an
  `[H,H]` ASR from the utility tree has no covering pattern.
- 🟠 **High** — deviates from a recorded ADR without justification; an external
  dependency missing a timeout / retry / degradation strategy; an N+1 or
  thundering-herd baked into the data flow.
- 🟡 **Medium** — structural improvement; a doc gap that fails the 6-Month Test.
- 🟢 **Low** — wording, nits, optional consistency fixes.

For data-model and schema findings, also apply the `database-design` skill's
"When Reviewing an Existing Schema" checklist rather than re-deriving criteria here.

## Reference Files

### Reading Order

**Always read**: `design-flow.md` + all three templates.

**Read based on Stage 0 findings**:
- Pattern selection -> `system-architecture.md`, `service-architecture.md`
- Technology selection (Stage 5, Component Design) -> `tech-stack.md` (house stack; deviations need an ADR)
- AI features in PRD -> `ai-architecture.md` (+ `ai-agents.md` if agents needed)
- Cross-cutting -> `operational-patterns.md`
- Writes that must not be lost / duplicated / interleaved -> `reliability-patterns.md`
- Stage 8 (Cross-cutting Concerns) -> `observability.md`

**Skip if PRD has no AI/LLM features**: `ai-architecture.md`, `ai-agents.md`

Every reference is linked directly from here, so read only what a stage needs.
Cross-links between reference files are optional pointers for going deeper — not
a required reading chain.
