### Observability Implementation Guide

This section covers practical setup for a Cloudflare Workers stack. The goal: maximum visibility with minimum cost and setup time.

#### Error Tracking: Sentry on Workers

**Use `@sentry/cloudflare`** (the official first-party SDK). The older `toucan-js` and `@hono/sentry` middleware are both deprecated.

Why `@sentry/cloudflare` over `toucan-js`:
- `toucan-js` sends events in-process, forcing the Worker to stay alive longer (increases billed wall time)
- Official SDK has full performance tracing, cron monitoring, and the unified Sentry API
- `@hono/sentry` middleware (which wrapped `toucan-js`) is deprecated — migrate to `@sentry/cloudflare` directly

**Prerequisites** — `wrangler.jsonc`:
```jsonc
{
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],  // required — SDK needs AsyncLocalStorage
  "version_metadata": { "binding": "CF_VERSION_METADATA" }  // release tracking
}
```

**Hono Worker** — wrap with `withSentry`:
```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>();
// ... routes ...

export default Sentry.withSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: env.SENTRY_DSN,
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,   // 100% early, reduce at scale
    sendDefaultPii: false,
  }),
  app
);
```

**Durable Objects** — wrap class with `instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry`:
```typescript
import { DurableObject } from 'cloudflare:workers';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';

class MyDOBase extends DurableObject<Env> {
  async fetch(request: Request) { /* ... */ }
}

export const MyDO = Sentry.instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({ dsn: env.SENTRY_DSN, tracesSampleRate: 1.0 }),
  MyDOBase,
);
```

**Workflows** — wrap with `instrumentWorkflowWithSentry`:
```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';
import { WorkflowEntrypoint } from 'cloudflare:workers';

class MyWorkflowBase extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    await step.do('fetch data', async () => { /* ... */ });
    await step.do('process data', async () => { /* ... */ });
  }
}

// Sentry uses instanceId to generate trace_id, linking all steps into one trace
// Spans should only be created inside step.do() callbacks
export const MyWorkflow = Sentry.instrumentWorkflowWithSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({ dsn: env.SENTRY_DSN, tracesSampleRate: 1.0 }),
  MyWorkflowBase,
);
```

**Cron/Scheduled handlers** — use `Sentry.withMonitor`:
```typescript
async scheduled(controller: ScheduledController, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
  ctx.waitUntil(
    Sentry.withMonitor('daily-cleanup', () => runDailyCleanup(env), {
      schedule: { type: 'crontab', value: '0 3 * * *' },
      checkinMargin: 5,    // minutes tolerance for start
      maxRuntime: 30,      // minutes before marked failed
    })
  );
}
```

**Queue consumers** — instrument with custom spans:
```typescript
async queue(batch: MessageBatch, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
  for (const message of batch.messages) {
    await Sentry.startSpan(
      { op: 'queue.process', name: `process-${message.id}` },
      async () => { /* process message */ }
    );
  }
}
```

#### Workers Automatic Tracing

Zero-code, OpenTelemetry-compliant spans. Enable in config, get full visibility.

**What it instruments automatically (no code changes):**
| Operation | Captured Attributes |
|---|---|
| Outbound `fetch()` calls | URL, method, status code, timing |
| KV reads/writes | Operation type, key, duration, error |
| R2 get/put/delete | Operation type, object key, duration, error |
| Durable Object calls | Object ID, method, duration |
| D1 queries | Query type, duration |
| Queue/scheduled handlers | Full handler lifecycle |

**What it does NOT cover (gaps):**
- Internal business logic timing (add custom spans via Sentry if needed)
- SQL query details through Neon/Hyperdrive (the HTTP fetch is traced, not the SQL itself)
- Custom business metrics (use Analytics Engine for those)

**Configuration:**
```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "observability": {
    "traces": {
      "enabled": true,
      "head_sample_rate": 1    // 0-1. Use 1 at low traffic, reduce at scale
    }
  }
}
```

**Pricing (as of March 2026):** Each span = one observability event, sharing the same monthly quota and pricing as Workers Logs.

**OTLP export** — send traces to external backends without code changes:
```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc — after creating destination in CF dashboard
{
  "observability": {
    "traces": {
      "enabled": true,
      "head_sample_rate": 1,
      "destinations": ["sentry-prod"]   // name from dashboard config
    }
  }
}
```

Sentry OTLP endpoint: `https://{HOST}/api/{PROJECT_ID}/integration/otlp/v1/traces`
Auth header: `sentry sentry_key={SENTRY_PUBLIC_KEY}`

#### Workers Logs

**Capabilities:**
- Stores `console.log()` / `console.warn()` / `console.error()` output
- Query Builder: filters, aggregations, groupings, graphical + tabular visualizations
- Query language: `status = 500`, `$workers.wallTimeMs > 100`, `contains(field, value)`, AND/OR/NOT
- Free text search across all metadata and attributes
- Save queries for reuse

**Limitations:**
- 7-day retention (Paid plan). Not long-term storage — use Logpush for that
- No built-in alerting (use Sentry alerts or BetterStack for that)
- Daily limit: 5B logs/account/day (1% sampling after limit — irrelevant at solopreneur scale)
- Max single log size: 256 KB

**Configuration:**
```jsonc
{
  "observability": {
    "logs": {
      "enabled": true,            // default for new Workers
      "head_sample_rate": 1,      // 0-1. Reduce at high volume
      "invocation_logs": "auto"   // "auto" | "off"
    }
  }
}
```

**Pricing:** $0.60/M log lines after included volume. At solopreneur scale this is effectively free.

#### Structured Logging

**Use `workers-tagged-logger`** — structured JSON logging with automatic context propagation via `AsyncLocalStorage`. No need to pass a logger through every function.

```typescript
import { Logger, withLogTags } from 'workers-tagged-logger';

const logger = new Logger();

// In your fetch handler (or Hono middleware):
return withLogTags({ requestId: crypto.randomUUID() }, async () => {
  logger.setTags({
    method: request.method,
    path: new URL(request.url).pathname,
    userId: getUserId(request),   // add after auth middleware
  });

  logger.info('request started');

  // Deep in your code — no logger parameter needed, tags propagate via ALS
  const result = await handleBusinessLogic(env);

  logger.info('request completed', { status: 200, durationMs: elapsed });
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(result));
});
```

For Durable Objects, use the `@WithLogTags` class method decorator for automatic context per method call.

**What to log:**
| Always | Never |
|---|---|
| Request ID (correlation) | Auth tokens, API keys, passwords |
| Route/path + method | Full request/response bodies in production |
| Response status code | PII without a retention policy |
| Duration (wall time) | |
| User/tenant ID (for debugging) | |
| Error stack traces on failure | |
| Queue: messageId, attempt count, outcome | |
| DO: object ID, operation type, duration | |

**Log levels:**
- `console.log()` → routine (request start/complete, business events)
- `console.warn()` → degraded (retries, fallbacks, slow queries)
- `console.error()` → failures needing investigation

**Sampling strategy:** At < 100K req/day, log everything. Above that, sample routine logs at 10-50% but keep 100% for errors. Use `head_sample_rate` in wrangler config for global sampling; use conditional logging in code for per-level control.

#### Analytics Engine (Custom Metrics)

Use for operational metrics that Cloudflare does not track automatically. Skip this on Day 1 if PostHog covers your product analytics.

**Good use cases:** p99 latency by endpoint, error rates by customer/tenant, queue processing duration, DO operation counts, feature usage counts.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "analytics_engine_datasets": [
    { "binding": "METRICS", "dataset": "app_metrics" }
  ]
}
```

```typescript
// Non-blocking — no await needed. Zero added latency.
env.METRICS.writeDataPoint({
  indexes: [request.url],                          // sampling key
  blobs: [request.method, '/api/users', '200'],    // string dimensions
  doubles: [responseTimeMs, 1],                    // numeric values
});
```

Query via SQL API or connect to Grafana. Create an API Token with Account Analytics Read permission.

#### Logpush

Sends Workers Trace Event Logs to external destinations for long-term retention. Add when 7-day Workers Logs retention is not enough.

**Cheapest path:** Push to R2 ($0.05/M requests).

**Setup:**
1. Dashboard > Analytics & Logs > Logpush
2. Dataset: "Workers trace events"
3. Destination: R2 (auto-creates bucket) or custom
4. Ensure `observability.logs.enabled = true` in wrangler config

**Other destinations:** S3, GCS, Azure Blob, Sumo Logic, Datadog, Splunk, BetterStack.

**Cost control:** Configure filters and sampling rate in Logpush to control data volume.

#### PostHog on Workers

Use `posthog-node` for server-side event capture. Critical configuration for Workers:

```typescript
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node';

// Create per-request (lightweight) — do NOT reuse across requests
const posthog = new PostHog(env.POSTHOG_API_KEY, {
  host: env.POSTHOG_HOST,
  flushAt: 1,          // CRITICAL: send immediately, no batching
  flushInterval: 0,    // CRITICAL: Workers terminate after response
});

// Capture event — use ctx.waitUntil to ensure delivery
ctx.waitUntil(posthog.shutdownAsync());  // flushes all pending events
posthog.capture({
  distinctId: userId,
  event: 'api_called',
  properties: { endpoint: '/api/users', method: 'POST' },
});
```

**Why `flushAt: 1` and `flushInterval: 0`:** Workers can terminate before batched async sends complete, causing silent data loss. These settings force immediate send.

**Known issue:** `captureImmediate()` may not properly await the internal `_capture` promise. Use `ctx.waitUntil(posthog.shutdownAsync())` as the reliable pattern.

#### Uptime Monitoring

You need **external** health checks — something outside Cloudflare pinging your endpoints.

| Service | Free Tier | Paid From | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BetterStack** | 10 monitors, 3-min checks | ~$21/mo per 50 monitors | Status page + incident management + on-call |
| **OpenStatus** | Hosted free tier; or self-host | Paid tiers available | Open source, 28 global regions, CF Pages status page |
| **UptimeFlare** | 100% free (runs on CF Workers + D1) | Free | Zero cost. Trade-off: monitoring CF from CF |
| **CF Health Checks** | Pro+ plans | Pro plan | Origin monitoring, not Workers-specific |

**Health endpoint pattern:**
```typescript
// GET /health — lightweight, frequent checks (every 1 min)
app.get('/health', (c) => c.json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: Date.now() }));

// GET /health/deep — dependency checks, less frequent (every 5 min)
app.get('/health/deep', async (c) => {
  const checks = await Promise.allSettled([
    checkNeon(c.env),        // SELECT 1
    checkR2(c.env),          // HEAD on known object
    checkDurableObject(c.env),
  ]);
  const allHealthy = checks.every(c => c.status === 'fulfilled');
  return c.json({ status: allHealthy ? 'ok' : 'degraded', checks }, allHealthy ? 200 : 503);
});
```

#### Alerting

Cloudflare has limited native alerting for Workers. Combine multiple tools:

| Alert Type | Tool | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Error spikes | Sentry alerts | Threshold: "new errors > 10/hour" or error rate > 1% |
| Cron missed/failed | Sentry Crons (`withMonitor`) | Automatic via cron instrumentation |
| Endpoint down | BetterStack / OpenStatus | External health check → Slack/email/SMS |
| CPU usage spike | CF Usage Notifications | Built-in: triggers when CPU is 25% above 7-day average |
| Build failures | Workers Builds Events | Event Subscriptions → Queue → Slack webhook |
| Slow queries | Neon dashboard | pg_stat_statements monitoring |

#### Neon Postgres Monitoring

Neon provides built-in monitoring — no extra tooling needed at solopreneur scale.

**Neon Console dashboard:**
- Connection graphs (idle, active, total)
- Pooler client/server connections (PgBouncer metrics)
- Autoscaling event timeline
- Query performance via `pg_stat_statements` (execution counts, avg/total time)
- Active queries via `pg_stat_activity`

**At scale:** Neon exports OpenTelemetry and Datadog metrics (including PgBouncer pooling metrics). Grafana Cloud has a native Neon integration for dashboards.

#### When to Add External Observability Tools

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| CF dashboard + Sentry answers all debugging questions | Stay with built-in tools |
| Spending > 30 min/week debugging production incidents | Add Honeycomb or Grafana Cloud |
| Need to correlate traces across > 3 Workers/DOs | Add Honeycomb (event-based pricing, unlimited cardinality) |
| Need pre-built dashboards + long-term metrics | Add Grafana Cloud (per-byte pricing) |
| Need log retention > 7 days | Add Logpush → R2 (cheapest) or Axiom (generous free: 500 GB/mo ingest) |
| Need to correlate Workers + Neon + external API metrics | Add Grafana Cloud (single pane of glass) |

**OTLP export is a config change, not a code change.** Workers traces are OpenTelemetry-compliant. Switching from CF dashboard to Honeycomb/Grafana/Axiom means adding a destination in the dashboard and a `destinations` array in wrangler config.

#### Day 1 vs Growth Observability

**Day 1 (Pre-launch / MVP) — $0/month additional:**

| Layer | Tool | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Error tracking | `@sentry/cloudflare` with `withSentry` (Hono), `instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry`, `instrumentWorkflowWithSentry` | 1 hour |
| Logs | Workers Logs enabled in wrangler.jsonc | 5 min |
| Tracing | Workers Automatic Tracing enabled in wrangler.jsonc | 5 min |
| Structured logging | `workers-tagged-logger` for JSON logs with request context | 1 hour |
| Product analytics | PostHog (already in stack) | — |
| Uptime | BetterStack free tier (10 monitors) or UptimeFlare | 30 min |

```jsonc
// Day 1 wrangler.jsonc observability config
{
  "observability": {
    "logs": { "enabled": true, "head_sample_rate": 1, "invocation_logs": "auto" },
    "traces": { "enabled": true, "head_sample_rate": 1 }
  }
}
```

**Growth (paying users, < 50K DAU) — ~$25-50/month additional:**

Everything from Day 1, plus:

| Layer | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Uptime (upgraded) | BetterStack paid (~$21/mo) | 1-min checks, SMS alerts, on-call |
| Log retention | Logpush → R2 | 30+ day retention, audit trail |
| Custom metrics | Analytics Engine | p99 latency, error rates by endpoint |
| Sentry tuning | Lower `tracesSampleRate` to 0.2-0.5 | Cost control |
| Alerting | Sentry alerts + BetterStack | Error spike + downtime detection |

**Scale (> 50K DAU, revenue > $10K MRR):**

Everything from Growth, plus:

| Layer | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Distributed tracing | Honeycomb or Grafana Cloud via OTLP | Multi-service debugging |
| Dashboards | Grafana Cloud or Honeycomb boards | Single pane of glass |
| Log analysis | Axiom or Grafana Loki (via Logpush) | Long-term querying beyond 7 days |
| Neon monitoring | Neon OTel → Grafana Cloud | Correlate DB + Workers metrics |
| Sampling | Lower `head_sample_rate` to 0.1-0.5 | Cost control at scale |
